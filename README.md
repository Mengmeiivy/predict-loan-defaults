# Predict defaults of personal loans for Lending Club
In this project, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms to predict defaults of personal loans on Lending Club, in the hope that it would not only help Lending Club achieve a higher accuracy in classifying its loans, but also increase the return of investments for its investors and decrease the cost of lending over time. 

Data can be found on Lending Club's website: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action. It includes data on its borrowers from 2007 to 2016. 

Run the program in the following order:

1. preprocess.py
2. process_desc.py
3. main.py

You can also find a proposal, a presentation and a final report for this project.
