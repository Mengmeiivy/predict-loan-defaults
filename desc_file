  Borrower added on 11/17/12 > I plan to use this loan to consolidate revolving credit into one monthly payment<br>

Loan Request:  I am a full time real estate investor. With the drought in financing to acquire homes I have lately been buying mobile homes located in mobile home parks with cash and renting them out.  I buy the mobiles with my cash and rehab them. Once the home is completed and filled with a tenant or tenant/buyer I obtain a private lending loan to recover my cost and to move on to the next project.  This loan would cover my acquisition and rehab cost for the property. The tenant pays a weekly rent of $120 a week. The lot rent is $170 a month. This property cash flows approximately $350 a month averaged out over the course of a year leaving plenty of room for a loan of $5000.  My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.  My private money website for the single family homes is located at http://www.privatedollar.com. My management company's website is located at http://www.picksimple.com.  Please note that my credit rating may seem risky however in general my score is most affected by my debt to income. I have several mortgages on my report in addition the income on my tax returns being lower due to the number of deductions I take from my business so please keep that in mind.  There are no late payments and I can provide references of private lenders who my local area who will verify my timely payments and also references of lenders who have loaned me money before and that I have paid off.  Thank you and I look forward to working with you.  Sincerely,  Michael Shane Wilson

Hi everyone!   About Me:  I'm a research scientist who recently graduated with a Masters in from Cornell. I also hold a degree in physics from Harvey Mudd College. I am also a National Science Fellowship recipient.  I am considered to be a responsible individual who is careful with my money and financially savvy. I regularly read the Economist, the Financial Times, and Bloomberg News. I have a Roth IRA and other investments. I've graduated with no debt and an emergency savings fund from work and my time as a graduate researcher. I've NEVER had any credit problems, and always pay my bills on time. Lending Club will do its own calculations, but a recent simulated FICO score placed me around 720. Should I lose employment, I expect to be able to pay off the loan completely out of existing savings/investments.  I decided to try this method to see if I can find a financing rate that is better than what is commercially available. Used car loans are not particularly generous with their APR offerings.  Thank you for your consideration. Whether you fund my loan or not, I appreciate your participation in a remarkable financial system, whose success at connecting borrowers and lenders has provided a critically useful service to each in this time of financial crisis.   Description of Loan Request  I'm looking to find some help financing a new-to-me car that will pass inspection. I am looking to buy a modestly priced, well-maintained cars from dealerships with Carfax reports and repair records. Among those I've priced are a 2002 Subaru Outback and a 2003 Toyota Camry.  I've opted for a used car, partly because of the steep discount in resale value new cars face after a few years, and partly because I hope to move downtown within the next year, reducing the need to commute to grocery shopping and discretionary excursions. (My city has an excellent public transportation system.)  The loan will be used to purchase the car, pay for title, and a reserve of 750 for anticipated repairs.  Again, thanks for your consideration!

  Borrower added on 09/25/13 > I will be consolidating my credit cards and a vehicle loan.<br>

  Borrower added on 12/09/10 > Thank you for this opportunity.  I plan to use these funds for consolidating debt.  In August of 2003, my father had a cerebral hemorrhage.  Due to his inability to work/support my family, I became my family's main financial crutch.  I immediately started working and used my credit cards to help relieve some of the doctor bills, utility bills, other household bills, etc.  Unfortunately, it has placed me in my current position of paying high monthly bills to several different credit card companies.  I will use 100% of this loan to pay these debts off.  A smaller monthly payment will relieve some of my financial headaches.  I have been using these cards for about five years, and have a very good payment history (paying above minimums, very rarely late).  My credit report will reflect this.  I pay almost $700 monthly to debt, and to be honest, I am desperate for peace-of-mind.  I am very dedicated to relieving this problem.  I have been in the food service industry for over five years now, and have been promoted several times.  I am currently a kitchen manager in a company based in my hometown.  My job is very secure, and I do not foresee any issues in paying my loan payments on time.  I have not had any problems in the past, and vow to keep it this way.  My pride will not allow me to beg, but I will be overwhelmed with joy if this loan is 100% funded.  Please help me and my family.  Thank you for your time.<br/>

  Borrower added on 06/22/10 > My fiancee and I are planning to get married soon and would like to start off being as close to debt free as we can get which means no more use of revolving credit.  This loan will be used to consolidate all revolving lines of credit so that there is one monthly payment.  I have been making double, sometimes triple, monthly payments on each of these lines of credit but am finding that the interest rates are making it difficult to see the balances going down.  This is the reason I am looking forward to consolidating these balances.  I will be able to pay more than the minimum and actually be able to see the balance drop.  <br/><br/>I am currently employed with the City of Lake Lotawana as Court Administrator.  Prior to moving to Missouri I was employed with the City of Prairie Grove, Arkansas for 8 years and before that I was employed by Tyson Foods, Inc for 13 years.  The only reason I left these jobs was due to relocation.  I have no plans to leave this area and, as I mentioned earlier, I plan on being married soon.  I would like to be completely debt free as soon as possible and have spoken to a financial counselor to help show us the best way to do so.  My fiancee is self employed and has been for 22 years and also has a steady income.  His name is not on this loan, but I think it's important to know how he is involved.  <br/>I would appreciate your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.<br/>

Our goal for this loan is to consolidate and lower the interest rate of two of our credit cards: 1. Visa - $14881.99 @ 23.24% APR  2. Wells Fargo - $2170.53 @ 21.9% APR  My other financial obligations are: Mortage + HELOC = $167,427.48 (Home appraised ~2006 in low $200K range) 3. Wells Fargo - $1821.06 @ 21.9% APR  4. Mastercard - $7858.01 @ 19.99% APR  5. JCP - $5590.17 @ 19.99% APR   Total payments per month, excluding mortage: $1181.65.

  Borrower added on 10/09/10 > I'm a young professional who moved to NYC less than one year ago. I moved here for my career and have been hired by a very financially-secure firm. From recent reviews with my colleagues I have no doubt that I have job security and can expect a decent-to-good increase in salary come February. Bonus makes up a very minor portion of my income so there is stability.<br/><br/>The money is to pay off a credit card and an old installment debt. These were run up a bit in my move to NYC as I got started here. I would like to consolidate these in order to be paying one central creditor instead of a couple. The interest rate offered here is better as well. Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Dave<br/>

We supply 100% recycled materials to businesses that wish to switch to becoming a green business. We work with the EPA Waste Wise Program and also get certifications for these business that use and buy our products. We supply sustainable goods that effect our Eco and waste systems. We are seeking a 25K loan for expansion as we have 6 over 400 room hotels that want our products in them and we are about to get a major airport as well. The funding is for stock and to hire 2 more sales reps, and because we are a new business our manufacturer is requiring COD for the first 1yr. of our shipments. We have been in business now for 7 months and have made a steady small profit which we put right back into the company. We have a web based sales launch planned for next March as well to bring these great products to the everyday consumer. I personally use all the products in my home. I would appreciate it if you could fund this loan as there are so many outlets for us to sell our products and make this world more green and better with the use of these products to help continue sustainability in our Eco and waste systems for the future. The bank loved our business plan but denied our loan because we were a start up, the catch 22. We have as I have said several National Hotel chains as clients, the airport deal will be done by October 1st and We as a company are growing rapidly and can sustain this loan. Our products are made from a process that is made of and from the bi products of sugar cane. We do paper products, 100% safe cleaners and everything even a restaurant can use for there take out products. I thank you for all of your investors that use this service and request that you fund our loan. Thank you.<br/><br/>We were on the website before, but removed due to a processing glitch in verifying our 4056 form. At that time all of you wonderful people had almost funded our loan request to 100%. We have reposted and ask that you continue to fund us to 100% as it was a glitch with the IRS with processing time to just verify our taxes which has been done now. Again Thank you for everyone that will be funding this loan. Also we have secured another hotel that wants to go and be GREEN in the mean time, while this processing was taking place. Thank you all again very much.<br/>Add more details to your loan description:<br/>

Along with my own debt, it has been a bit overwhelming, but I  I have an excellent job, lots of motivation and determination.  I have ways to pay off debt, where she does not.

I am not looking to continue to keep more than one cc. when pd off. I will close and pay off.  I believe I should let them report paid with a o balance and then start closing them.

I am starting a retail craft supply and pottery painting studio.  I have a good relationshiip with my bank and was told last summer that I would have no trouble getting the SBA loan when I needed it.  With the financial crisis, all of that changed and they couldn't get me the SBA loan.    I will be funding about half of the start up costs myself and am looking for funding for the remainder.   This business is one of the few industries that is not feeling the recession.  As people can no longer afford to take vacations, the advent of the 'staycation' has emerged.  Now families are looking for things to do at home.  My studio will provide a place for people to come and learn new crafts, scrapbooking, pottery painting, home decorating, etc.  Unlike a big box craft store, mine will focus more on the classes and how to use the products that are out there.

  Borrower added on 03/17/11 > The time has come to liquidate all of my credit card debt. The purpose of this loan is to accomplish that.<br/><br/>This is my second loan with the LendingClub, and the first one has been in good standing since August of 2010.<br/><br/>I am applying this second loan toward the elimination of all my credit card debt.<br/><br/>I am an airline pilot, have been since 2000, and as my income is steadily increasing, I am looking to eliminate paying ongoing interest to credit card companies. This loan will allow me to accomplish that and be done with paying it off within 3 years.<br/><br/>My gratitude and regards to everyone who is interested in assisting me toward this goal, and making money in the process.<br/> Borrower added on 03/23/11 > Thank you to all who so far funded the loan. As you may have notice, the credit review finalized their approval as well.<br/><br/>Please keep in mind, once this loan is funded, it will allow me to pay off all of my other liabilities.<br/><br/>I know lots of borrowers may say this, however, I would like to show all of you how much of a good investment this would be for all of you. Because I have been carrying all these lines of credit, the loan is listed as F2. But one additional fact, which a credit report never gets to say is, even when I was not fortunate to have the income I now have, I still kept everything paid up and to date. I have maintained a stellar payment history on all my loans, secured or unsecured for a very long time, and most importantly, even when I could barely afford to eat on the leftover money.<br/><br/>Please accept these comments with my respect and gratitude as you consider funding my loan.<br/><br/>Gratefully!<br/> Borrower added on 03/24/11 > To the member who asked about the previous loan, I have entered the loan number. My member ID for that loan is Member_732232. Regards.<br/> Borrower added on 03/27/11 > The additional good news is that one of the banks agreed to settle the total amount owed on my credit card for 70 percent of the value. I am almost afraid to even mention this here, for fear they might change their mind. If this happens, I stand to pay for all the costs of this loan and almost all its interest with the reduction this bank agreed to.This happened in the last two days, and I pursued this question in light of the fact that the funding was going well. So, it looks like, once this loan is funded, its real costs will be paid by the reduction mentioned above, and the benefit.<br/><br/>As I found out about this possible reduction, I will try to negotiate with the other banks and further reduce the debt.<br/><br/>Thank you to all of you for making this possible. Enjoy the return on your investment, as I won't let you down.<br/>

 This loan will pay for an operation to remove what has become a large benign growth in a sensitive area.  I've been at my current job & address for over 10 years, have very good credit (the last time I checked), and have the ability to increase my income at will (I am a relatively well-known musician in this area and can perform as much as I want). My day job is in the fire safety business; I have a state fire extinguisher license; my current job is very stable, but companies are always looking for licensed technicians, so my employment future is very stable.  Respectfully, Ronald Eugene Parrish.

I have an American Express Platinum card that has nearly $5000 in flexible spending. The flexible spending account is charging me around 15% right now and I am sick of the high interest rate.   It is a relatively new service for Amex and when it started you could pick which charges to use for the service. I travel a lot for work and somehow I managed to put an entire trip on it, but this allowed me to put a good down on an engagement ring for my fiance. Anyway I have had the debt entirely too long and really want to pay it off.   The loan will be payed with web bill pay through Navy Federal Credit Union, so I won't even see it leave my account. I am an engineer that makes pretty good money and I am honest so feel assured about repayment.

As a supervisor for a fortune 50 company many people who work for me have benefited from micro loans.  These are loans that can be obtained through web sites like LendingClub and Prosper at rates lower rates then traditional brick and mortar financial institutions.     I am looking for you to fund this loan so that I can reinvest in other loans.  With my good credit you can insure your will be repaid.  My good credit will help insure a good rate that provides enough margin for me to invest in other peoples loans with higher rates/risk and still come out clean.  This is a great service that allows you to earn a low risk return and allow me to potential earn a small amount on higher risk loans.  Regardless of the earning potential of reinvestment, I have plenty of liquid assets to cover this loan.

Hello,  I am up to winning a $500k NASA sponsored competition called the "Regolith Excavation Challenge" (http://regolith.csewi.org/).  What the competition is about is finding new and innovative ways to move dirt on the Moon. This is done by having competitors build robots which can excavate 150kg (330lbs) of "moon dirt" (or more) within 30 minutes, in "lunar conditions".  We have already built an initial prototype, which can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h85bMvGiJE  You can also follow us at: http://moondiggers.com  Why we will win: - I have a strong background in robotics. I have previously assisted in leading the "Red Team", a team who eventually won the Urban Challenge for robotics, a competition where cars had to drive themselves in Urban environments. - We have a working prototype, that meets the minimum requirements, and are now iterating to ensure that no one else can match what we have built.  For myself, and why I will pay this loan no matter how the competition turns out: - I have a Master's of Science in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University - I have made 90k+ per year prior to joining the current space startup I am participating in. - If I fail in this competition, my intention is to get a "normal job" until I pay off my debt. - I have never missed a payment, even though I have on occasion had high balances.

  Borrower added on 03/27/13 > Paying off 3 high interest credit cards, closing those accounts.<br>
Hi, I am a professional in the cancer research community.  I would like to consolidate my credit card debt into one loan. After doing so I will only have my car loan left ( one more year to pay off) and two store cards with small balances and zero percent interest.  I have zero delinquencies and late pays on my credit history.And my credit score was in the 700's. Recently though, as you my have read in the news, Chase bank has closed over two million credit card accounts, most of them from Washington Mutual. Well unfortunately I had my credit card eggs in a small basket. Even though both accounts had over 8000 in credit limits between them and had zero balances they chose to close one of them and reduce the credit limit on the other to 500.00. They said it was a corporate decision based on the WAMU accounts. While I respect their decision it also hurts my credit rating. I should have diversified more and had more cards but I don't like having lots of credit cards. The reason I have the debt I do have is from medical bills for my dog. Also the inquiries I have are from when I was getting quotes to lower my car insurance.Other then that I am a stay at home and watch a movie kind of girl. Drive the same car for years. And put your max into your 401k each month.Now since I want to consolidate the debt I do have and put my score back where it should be I thought Lending Club would be the good way to go. Get a manageable loan, and improve my credit score. While I am new to Lending Club, I do have a paid off loan with Prosper, it was some of the lenders there way back who said Lending Club was a better way to go.   I also want to add I am a renter, but in South Florida that's a good thing right now. I have lived in the same house for almost four years and don't have an overpriced house to worry about. Thank you for taking the time to look at my listing. Have a great day.

Please know that I would happily be willing to verify my income if needed.Â <br/><br/>I am a trust assistant at Bank of America US trust. It is an adminastrive position that offers a career path towards becoming a Trust officer. I should have an opportunity for such a promotion in about two years, mabey sooner.There is plenty of job security becuase we specialize in lower market value trusts and migrating trusts. It is for this reason that we are always receiving an influx of business.Â <br/><br/>I currently have no car payment, and a low interest student loan with a monthly payment of $65. I Fully intend to use this loan for the sole purpose of paying off my credit cards. My revolvong balance is about $8,600, however I have an additional credit balance of around $1,750. This amount is NOT included in my revolving balance, because the creditor decided to close this account. They based this decision on the current number of revolving credit balances that I have. I am assuming they found it uneconomical to keep this account open. So, the total amount I owe is about 10,600. I am planning to pay this entire amount with this loan and my 2009 tax refund.Â <br/>I have an emergency savings of $800 and I am building this amount with $50-$100 each month. I am also interested in lowering my monthly rental and utiliy expenses by, searching for a new living situation.Â <br/><br/>I have made my share of repeated spending mistakes in the past. During the Â last year and a half I have proven to myself that I am able to spend within my means, and make wise financial decisions. I do not rely on credit cards anymore. I only spend what I can afford in cash after contributing to my savings.<br/><br/>It is my hope and wish that your faith an investment will give me the opportunity to experience the same financial freedom that you feel. Thank you so much for your help and your thoughtfullness. Â  Â  Â Â <br/>

Hi all who wish to lend, I am a recently sworn in American citizen very proud of being an American and proud father of 2 with my lovely wife expecting a 3rd.  I have a great job in the business consulting industry and I make good money.    I am basically trying to get rid of a high interest debt that I took on for my family in India. A year ago my brother needed a hand with setting up a business so he could take care of our parents in India.  Then, my mom got sick and overnight I had to send $10's of thousands of dollars for back surgery costs not covered in India (Insurance sucks).  Well now here I am with a family thats growing and needing to be out of debt but the loan I took out for $11,000 has $4,000 still left of high interest which i would like to reduce interest rate on and pay off quicker.  Anybody reading this kindly know that I am looking for the community to help fund it with the hopes I can do that back the same some day.  Your time is greatly appreciated and If you have any questions, not sure if you can ask here but you are welcome to :)

I only recently got into serious debt.  It's not serious enough to qualify for debt consolidation services in ordinary institutions, because my total debt is less than $5000.  I only have $700 limit credit card and unfortunately, I don't currently meet the credit limitations criteria.  I got into real trouble with payday loans and their high interest rates. Now, it seems I can't get out of the vicious cyle. It was a current crisis that put me in this situation and for the  past 6 years I've been working hard to improve my credit score.  I don't want it to get worse and would love an opportunity to consolidate all of these into one low interest loan.  Until my recent problem, I was paying all bills on time and had no NSF's on my bank statements.  I appreciate anything anyone can do to help.

The only problem that I find with the house is that when it was built back in the mid 50&rsquo;s &ndash; they built very small rooms and the words &ldquo;master bedroom&rdquo; must not have been heard of &ndash; and that is what I plan on adding with this loan.  There is space on the back side of  the house &ndash; which has a view of the valley and I envision it as my &ldquo;little escape from the real world &ndash; get away from the kids and pets and curl up and read, nap, relax, master bedroom.&rdquo;  They didn&rsquo;t think of that in the mid 50&rsquo;s!!<br/><br/>I have used the Lending Club before and with great success. I know what my budget is and how to work within that budget.  I am not one to over extend my self &ndash; because I don&rsquo;t like being a slave to debt.

 I currently have $15,000 spread out over 7 credit cards- with interest rates ranging from 9.99% to 18.99%.  I would like to consolidate this debt into one loan so that I can reduce my interest rate and pay it off in a timely manner.  I own my car outright- I have moved back in with my parents and pay no rent or utilities while I am paying off my debt.  Last year I grossed $48,000 and this year I am looking at a considerable increase in salary.  I have established credit for over 8 years without any late payments on record.  I pay ontime- everytime!  I have a degree in Business from one of the nation's top business schools and currently work at an insurance brokerage-  this debt was incurred while going to school full time while funding my sick grandmother's last two years of life.  I am on track to be succesful but simply need to eliminate my debt.  I hope you will consider my request and approve my loan.  Respectfully Yours-

I always pay over the amaount on my credit cards, but I feel like I can not get ahead.  I have been really stressing out thinking about my retirement.

My wife is unemployed but graduated with a Bachelor's in Fisheries and Wildlife Biology.  I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.  I am a Software Engineer for ClearPointe Technology and have been for over 3 years.  Before that, I was a Software Developer for Acxiom Corporation.  My current employer is currently experiencing a great deal of growth as the service we provide for our customers, managed IT services, saves the customer money and has been very popular during the recession.  Our company has bought and integrated 3 other companies in the past year.  I currently build and maintain several key systems at my company and have committed to this growing company for the long-haul.  I receive a base salary, that is very adequate for the needs of my wife and me.<br/>* Other debt I currently have besides the $9000 or so in credit cards include two small student loans from my wife at an extremely low interest rate ($10,000 at &lt; 4%, ~$100/mo), a car payment ($9,000 at 6.5%, ~$280/mo), and a mortgage payment ($102,000 at 4.375%, ~650/mo).  <br/>* Although I plan to pay this loan off more quickly than 3 years, and that could lower the amount of money you make, by funding this loan you will be helping me get out of debt quicker, and give more free money to save for my wife and I possibly having a child one day.  Also, both my wife and my parents are also in poor financial shape and we would be able to increase the amount of assistance that we are able to provide for them.  Thanks in advance!<br/>

I've been blessed with holding onto my job through this down economy and paying down debt. I just paid off 6 accts in the past month totaling $4K. I have 3 more accts to pay off totaling $20K w/ an avg 25% APR (not incl my car loan which is @ 6% APR and didn't make sense to roll into this loan request). I'm able to pay this current outstanding debt every month without the funding of this loan, however, I'd like the opportunity to pay it down at half the APR as offered in this loan. If I'm funded for this loan, I'll be able to pay it off in 10-20 mos, sooner than the 3-yr term offer. My loan repayment is scheduled for $700/mo but I can afford $1K-$2K/mo and still meet my monthly living expenses. I want to transform from a debtor into an investor, esp since I'm in the stretch to provide for my retirement.

 Hi,   I am looking to borrow $4000 in order to consolidate some outstanding debt which is at a high interest rate and also use some of these monies to buy some necessary purchases for my apartment and some suits for work.  I make $75,000 a year annually in salary (started making that high of a salary last year) and normally should receive about 10-15% bonus each year, but because of the bad economy, I am only expected to get about 4%.  I do have high balances on my credit cards, but I have never defaulted or most importantly never been a day late on any credit card payments which spans about 12 years.  I am very responsible when it comes to paying my debts as you can see by my credit history, just need to lower rates and get a little ahead of the game in the next couple of years in order to pay this debt down.  I live in an apartment in my parents house and only pay about $300 a month to help them cover some of the costs associated with the apartment.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks.  Kind Regards,

Hello! I am employed full time, attend school full time in pursuit of my BA (only 9 more months to go!), and I live with my hubby & 2 year old son.  My hubby was laid off from his job in October 2008, and (thankfully) joined the ranks of the employed again this past April, but it took a toll on our finances.  I'm hoping to get our loan approved so that we can consolidate our bills into one payment with a fixed payment schedule.  

 Looking to purchase 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer.  The vehicle has been completely inspected and has very low miles - 24,000!  The purchase price is well below retail value.  I am a responsible father, with a solid employment record.  I am always on time with my payments, and have very little outstanding debt.  My current vehicle, which I paid cash for nearly four years ago, is becoming a liability, and with a new baby in the family, a safe and reliable vehicle has become a priority.    Thank you for your consideration.  RD Franske

Business Credit is the driving force for this loan! I plan to deposit $6,000 into a safe and secured certificate of deposit (CD) at an FDIC local bank, borrow against it, to build credit with the bank so that I can get an large loan, purchase collateral, equipment and use strategic marketing to take my future business to the next level.   My ultimate goal is to build a long-term relationship with my local banks so that my stockholders can yield a safe return.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have a well-established credit record, numerous revolving credit lines, I am dependable and reliable, and self-motivated and a record of paying on time.  Thank you for your time and consideration

  Borrower added on 04/13/10 > Purpose of Loan: To pay for part of a home improvement project on my parent's home.<br/><br/>Background: My parent's underestimated the amount of money required for their home improvement project. They are short $10k and need my help. If they do not get my help, work on the project will cease indefinitely. <br/><br/>Personal Background: I am single with no children. I have no other loans. I am an officer in the United States Marine Corps. My job is stable. <br/><br/>Financial Background: My net worth is over $50k. I save over half my net income. I have paid off $40,000 in student loans four years ahead of schedule. I pay my credit card in full every month and use it only for big ticket item purchases. For other daily expenses, I always pay cash. I drive a used car that is paid in full.<br/><br/>My monthly budget is as follow:<br/><br/>$1500: Expenses (rent, food, haircuts, gas, uniforms)<br/>$3300: Savings and Investment accounts<br/><br/>Why am I borrowing instead of using my own money?<br/><br/>Because most of my savings are tied up in CD's, index funds, and other less liquid accounts. Also, I cannot afford to use $10k of my own money because it will seriously deplete my rainy day fund. And I don't like using it for home improvement projects because it doesn't qualify as a rainy day eligible. <br/><br/>Last word: My record speaks strongly of me as a reliable borrower. I have a 780+ credit score, proven borrower track record, low debt to income ratio, a stable job with the US government, and plenty of leverage to cover this loan in a worst case scenario.<br/>

Because of the housing market downturn, the lender did refinance the loan in January 2011, but is requiring a $20,000 principal paydown in 18 months.  This year, I have paid down $7,000 on the principal along with the monthly payments of $900.  The purpose of this loan is to pay the balance of the principal requirement now which will create a larger margin of cash flow for the next 3 years.  The property is not upside down.  I purchased it for $175,000 and owe $102,000.  They did not require an appraisal for the refinance.  All three units have been remodeled since I purchased the property.  One occupant has been with us since 2006.  The other 2 have lived there since 2007.  They are stable tenants and always pay their rent on time.<br/><br/>Some information about me:  I work full-time for an investment firm in their technology area.

Hello  I am simply looking to consolidate my credit cards. Because of all the changes in the terms, my interest shot up from 11% to 23% for no reason. I'm not going to play their games and rather save money by using this unique system.  Im not planning on using that card for years and my other card will be used to accumulate points and be paid in full every month.  Thanks  Mauricio Perez

  Borrower added on 08/17/10 > Hello everyone and I want to thank you in advance for helping me get rid of my credit card debt. My debt started to jump as soon as I had to move out of my ex's house. Even though my apartment rent isn't that huge, once you start buying groceries and paying bills, you get backed up, especially if you don't have the money to begin with. I have just gotten to a point where I pay so much on many little bills that keeping up is getting impossible. I needed a way to get all my bills into one without screwing up my credit like most consolidation loans do. I have about 11,000 in credit card debt, 5-6,000 in student loans, 3,000 in medical bills, and a 12,000 car loan. 18,000 was the highest I could get so whatever I can pay off will help tremendously. Obviously I need to pay my credit card debt because the interest rates are high, even higher than 16%. After that, I need to put the rest towards my other bills. I feel like such a failure, I am an educated woman with a masters degree and the fact that I could get myself into this much trouble makes me sick. I barely sleep at night thinking about how I can help myself get out of this. <br/><br/>Any help would be appreciated more than you know. Thank you.<br/>Julie<br/>

My company is Silver Lining Investment Properties LLC, and we have been in business since 2007 buying and selling residential houses.   We buy bank owned houses at .40 to .50 cents on the dollar and then resell them to retail buyers and investors for .80 cents on the dollar. It is great to see new home owners in an affordable house with pre-existing equity. Our company runs about 3 to 5 properties at a time.   Since the current credit meltdown our business lines of credit with two of our banks and loan programs have disappeared. We now need to reinvest most of our profits to fund any new properties we purchase, which is fine, but ties up a lot of our cash and is keeping us from expanding our business.   This loan would help us with a down payment on a great property deal in Portland, Oregon. We just had an offer accepted by Umpqua Bank for $225,000 and need to put 20% down to get financing or $45,000.  We are investing $34,000 of our own cash for the down payment and still need $11,000 to meet the 20% down payment requirement of $225,000. The property is valued at $399,000 which is very conservative market price; two comparables on the same street have sold for about $425,000 in the last 2 months. It is in a great neighborhood by great schools, and it is too good of an opportunity to pass up.  -The loan will be paid off in 6 months to 1 year, after the house is sold or refinanced.    Thank you for your consideration,  Michael Allen Silver Lining Investment Properties LLC Owner

  Borrower added on 11/25/12 > Debt consolidation<br>



  Borrower added on 11/15/11 > Hi,<br><br>My reason for this loan is two-fold: consolidate debt and reduce my interest rates.<br><br>I bought a house under my parents' name and needed to make a substantial down-payment by using cash advances. Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions. Thank you to those who have supported the loan!<br><br>

**Note: Lending Club had to repost this submission because the original lending amount was listed as $8000 when it should've been $6500.**  I'm looking to propose to my girlfriend of almost 4 years.  We actually are already living together now.  She means the world to me and I want to give her the world.  I'm creating a very unique engagement ring and need a loan to make this purchase.  I don't have any student loans or car loans, so this is my first time requesting a loan.  I do own 2 credit cards, and I feel like for a large amount of money, I don't trust it on a credit card that can so easily adjust my APR on the whim.  I pay my monthly payments without any problems.  I have a very stable full time job working in IT in a hospital where I've been for over 4 years.  I have a down payment to put on the ring and just need to cover 6500 of it.  I heard excellent things about this site and you have a great APR.  I hope you'll consider me for this loan as it's going to beautiful cause.  Thank you very much!  ~Chris

  Borrower added on 07/15/13 > Getting out of debt an life back on track.<br>
The purpose of this loan is 3 fold. First is to pay of a $3,000 credit card debt. The other two is for an investment/business purpose. I would use a portion of the loan to fund my existing rental property. The other investment is in a health and nutrition company that would yield immediate profit from selling products.  My parent have an auto laon that is under my name. This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.   I am an excellent candidate because I have great credit history and payment for the last 7 years when I first established credit. My fico score is 736 on Equifax. My cost of living is going to change dramatically. I will be moving back with my family to once again help them out. But I am looking forward to it since it would reduce my expenses by $700-$800 monthly. This would afford me the opportunity to get the wheels of the financial fortune turning. I just need a little jump start. I work as a "middle man" in a restaurant, in other words, I'm a waiter and make pretty good income. Thanks for you time folks.

 519397 added on 10/22/09 > Just like most people with credit card balances I've been hit hard by the economy. . . but, to elaborate on what I'm sure has become a clichÃ© statement, my problems are from the high interest rates that have been added to my higher balance cards. Managing credit has been a pretty streamlined process thus far, being able to carry most of my debt on cards that have been prime +1% and sub 10% apr cards but recently the cards I've so comfortably held my balances have dropped rates like 29.9%  and 21.9% as standard rates on my already higher balances. I'd like to blame it on the companies, calling it a sort of bait and switch method but I have to take most of the blame considering how long I carried balances on some of these cards. I've never missed a single payment on any of my loans or lines of credit and I don't have issues paying what I do owe but it isn't moving in a positive direction now with these rates and I would like to get rid of these balances. I've already put up all of my cards and have no plans to use them. I've even cut up and even closed some of my higher balance cards. Now it's time to become debt free.   I've been at my place of emplyment for 4 years come December and am in a secure position. I'm confident in my ability to pay and will stay current on all my debts. i just need to get this taken care of.

 Hello,  I am hoping for assistance to consolidate my debt.  Within the last few years with my current employer, I've reduced my overall debt by about 30%.

  Borrower added on 12/20/10 > I've been at my job for the past five years. Throughout this time my goal has been to eliminate debt. I've managed to pay down some of my debt, but there are a few credit cards that I think I pay off sooner if I had a lower interest rate, which is why I decided to apply for this loan. I will be using these funds to pay off a line of credit with SACU (Balance $1000), GE Money account (Balance approximately $3000), and a credit card from Macy's (approximately $800). Once these are paid off I plan to close the accounts so that I can continue to pay down my debt until I am debt free. The great thing about consolidating these three items is that the payment for my loan with Lending Club is actually less than all three payments combined. I plan to continue sending the same amount as if I was paying each three creditors in order to pay off my loan sooner. Thank you.<br/>

 I need to pay off 3 credit cards. I am a General Manager of a Country Club and my wife is a teacher. We own our home, and have a small child. I have not missed a payment on anything in at least the last five years and the one derrogatory score on my credit is being disputed as it was a credit card from colleges that my parents paid off. I need a better rate than the original offer as my main credit card is at 9%.

I would like to erase my debt with credit card companies completely. I believe that this loan would help me to pay off the creditors and begin to live a debt free life! Once paying off the creditors, I plan to start a media consulting business for churches. I am already employed at a church with about 10 other churches looking to get me to come in on weekends and help them.   A loan at 9.79% is extremely more feasible than paying off 2 credit cards with ridiculously high interest rates!  Thanks!

I have credit card debt that I would really like to eliminate as quickly as possible.  I have thought about withdrawing from my IRA, which I know is a last resort and can be costly in the long run, but at least the $$ is mine and I don't have to pay anyone back.  I read about Lending Club in Time Magazine, and thought I would try this option.  I'm trying to secure a better rate because the interest each month is killer.  I have an excellent credit score and always pay more than the minimum amount.  I just want to pay it back more agressively and am hoping a lower rate can assist with this.

  Borrower added on 07/12/13 > I would like to pay off my credit cards and live free of debt<br>

  Borrower added on 02/11/11 > My plan for using the funds from the new loan is to pay off all credit card debt totaling approximately $19,000.00 at a minimum monthly payment of approximately $505.00. Current interest rates range for 12.90% to 26.99%. I will also be paying off the balance of my car of $14,900.00 with a payment of $683.00. Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back. While the housing market has been soft I have not had a decree in my income and my credit has not suffered. The large part of the debt is from my ex-wife which I took to help her knowing that she would not be able to pay which could affect my credit. I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments. The main goal for this loan is to get out from under the credit card lenders and their high rates as well as getting the debts from my ex wife paid off.<br/>  <br/>Regarding my job stability, last year was one of my highest income years since I have been in the new home building market, 9 years total and each year is better for me. I just had my yearly review from corporate and I have been asked to open a new subdivision in one of the area&rsquo;s best markets so my income is projected to rise again.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 02/12/11 > The following is the break down of my current debt;<br/>Chase, $1,664 - 26.99% - $56 min<br/>Chase, $5,798 - 25.24% - $180 min<br/>Sears, $720 - 25.24% - $15 min<br/>USAA AMEX, $4,955 - 15.9% - $117 min<br/>Capital One, $1,520 - 14.66% - $35 min<br/>Capital One, $80 - 13.40% - $15 min<br/>Household Bank, $4,300 - 12.9% - $90 min<br/>Addison FCU (car), $14,900 - 6.9% - $682.97 monthly<br/><br/>My current mortgage balance is $315,000 and valued about $345,000.<br/><br/>I hope that this additional information is helpful in reaching your decision.<br/><br/>Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 02/18/11 > Some additional information for investors;<br/>After using an online debt reduction calculator and inputting the details of the proposed loan I have calculated that I should be able to repay this note as early as 39 months keeping my current payment structure at $1,200.

The purpose of the loan is to let two working professionals be happily married after many years of a career first attitude. The loan is going to be used for the purchase of an engagement ring for the perfect woman. I recently completed graduate school with a master's degree. I worked full-time, was a full-time student, and still had to take out student loans. I'm responsible, a very hard worker and have a strong work ethic, as a result, I have promoted within the company. I work a leading company that manufactures devices, medical related disposable items, and provides in-clinic services. This is a very stable job with plenty of opportunities to continue promoting up the corporate ladder. Monthly expenses fit within the earnings to debt ratios. I have a solid repayment plan: an initial 10% of the loan will be paid within one month of funding. Then 25% will be added to each monthly loan payment allowing the loan to be paid in full approximately 27 months early. The bottom line is that I still need help making our dreams come true.

I am a psychotherapist in private practice. My full time business has grown steadily over the past 2.5 years. (I have been in business a total of 5 years, 2.5 years part time.) My client load has been consistent with some drop in numbers around the holidays in December of 2008. Things appear to be picking up again, despite the economy. I consider myself a successful business person and am quite good at marketing for new clients. Compared to most other therapists starting out in private practice, I have managed to grow my business relatively quickly.  My loan request is for a business expense. I am currently collecting my post graduate hours towards licensure. I currently see my supervisor every other week. With this loan, I could see her weekly. The more I see her the faster I will get licensed. Once licensed, I would be eligible to accept insurance from clients or at least petition to insurance companies to get registered on the insurance boards. This move will be one more thing to secure multiple income streams and guarantee my continued success.  Please consider funding this loan. Thank you.

Citibank called and asked permission to up my rate to 24.99%, when I declined they closed the account; they are the bulk of my debt. I would like to consolidate all my open debt to a better rate. I have a Prosper loan from 9 months ago that worked so well I decided to get another but I've found Lending Club to have much better rates.<br/><br/>I work as a bartender on the Las Vegas Strip, I've lived here around 6 years. I share a house with 4 people so my rent is very low , my car payment is $192/month, and my income is a conservative estimate because I need to use the IRS estimate of $18.11/hour tips + $8.25/hour wage for verification purposes.<br/><br/>I have one ding on my credit score from 6 years ago that will expire next year. When I first moved to Las Vegas I went 6 months without a job and borrowed money from my parents to pay off a debt for less than what was owed. I was able to keep all my other debts current. My parents have been payed back of course :)<br/>

I ordinarily would just switch credit cards to a different company, but with this economy nobody is approving anybody.

I've been making all my payments on time with this card and often 2-4 times the minimum amount. However the 23% APR on the card which the company does not want to lower is too much. The only thing I charge on this card is tuition, which now in hind sight I should have got a student loan when I started. I work full time and will be graduating with my Bachelor's in June.  I don't mind paying off the debt, I would just like to pay more towards the principal and less towards interest so I can get out of debt sooner.

My goal is to fly daily flights in Orlando and other markets around the World. For every 500 people that pay, I will open a new market in one of the Top 100 most populated cities in the World.  http://offline-advertising.com  This service works like this:  Internet Marketers that want to leverage offline advertising pay a monthly fee to have their affiliate link saved in a link rotator that is promoted with a single co-op website.  This co-op website is promoted with a huge 30' tall by 90' long Aerial Billboard flown DAILY over the most populated tourist attractions and cities in the World.  I need this loan to purchase the huge 30' by 90' Aerial Billboard and start the Daily flights in Orlando Florida.  Once we start flying daily, the price for each subscriber will be $157 first month, then $97 a month thereafter.  The ultimate goal is to have an Aerial Billboard flying somewhere in the World 24/7.  We are promoting some of the hottest Internet Business available today. And can add more as they come on to the scene.  So the customer base is huge. As millions of people are looking for additional income streams from home based businesses.  Please help me get this new service off the ground, literally!  http://offline-advertising.com

Hello,  I'm looking to refinance my existing debt as I feel I can get a better interest rate versus my current credit card lenders. With a fixed amortization schedule I can have more flexibility with my cash flows and other financial needs. I have two credit cards open and have not had any history of default whatsoever. Also, I own a home and pay my mortgage on the first of every month - I can assure you that a payment will not be missed.  I am currently employed for an investment firm and have been with the firm for 3 years now since completion of my degree in Business Finance from Santa Clara University. Despite the depressed marco environment, our firm is in very good shape in terms of operations as the firm has raised a fund worth $130+MM in capital for deployment over an 8 year cycle. I have job security and a steady income and would consider myself a safe investment for lenders.  I'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have.  Thanks,

  Borrower added on 03/09/10 > My grandmother and her sister have worked at the same florist for the past 15 years. This florist specialized in funerals and weddings on top of the usual seasonal business you would expect in this industry (valentines day, mother's day, etc.). In the past few years the previous owner moved to Alabama and began to let the flower shop's operations become neglected and inconsistent. She recently closed the florist due to the complication of trying to operate the business from Alabama. <br/><br/>I plan to reopen the Florist shop in the same location because most of the larger equipment is still there, including a $10,000 walk-in cooler and display for the flowers. Having this equipment alone will make reopening the shop easier, and to add to that benefit my grandmother and her sister (who used to keep the books, and operated the business) have offered to work to get the business back to a profitable condition. They are confident that they will be able to earn back the business of all the major funeral homes in the area as well as the local courthouses and churches.<br/><br/>The Location that I have a pending contract on has little to no competition within about 10-15 miles in any direction. And is located on a high traffic volume state road, right next door to a Starbuck's coffee shop that has been very successful. <br/><br/>The landlord of the property has a good relationship with my family and has agreed to verbally commit the property to me until I am certain about the financing. He has also agreed to offer very generous concessions even though he has had two other possible florists show interest in the location.<br/><br/>Total operation costs including all expenses, labor and inventory averaged less than $5,000. My Grandmother and her sister informed me that on an average Valentine's Day week alone the store would generate over $10,000 in sales. They also assured me that one wedding would cover the expenses for an entire month, not including walk-ins and other sales.<br/><br/>I am a future CFA (Certified Financial Analyst), so I am very responsible with my financial condition and have a great financial and accounting background. I also have been managing and operating small and large businesses for almost all of my professional career.<br/>

Hi there! The purpose of my request is to allow for consolidation of my existing debt. The amount I am requesting will be used to payoff balances and consolidate to one payment as it would be a lot easier to manage and pay down faster as a whole. I am a great candidate for this loan because I have excellent repayment history (never late), established credit history (11 years), a good credit score, gainfully employed and also have a side business. I have used my credit responsibly and would like to paydown my balances as I look to the future.  I would rather go with peer to peer lending as I believe the interest rates are better. Also, I would rather give back to individual investors than banks because I now believe this is a better way to do business.

  Borrower added on 09/21/10 > I am a furloughed state of california employee.  I am also a young business professional.  I have worked hard to make sure I could purchase a home, buy an economical car to get to and from work, and make sure that I can do everything without overextedning myself.  Then, in February 2009, the governor began issuing 2 day per month furloughs equalling just under 10% of my monthly salary.  Then, in June 2009, he increased that to just under 14% (3 days per month).  Now that the furlough order has ended, I am able to get back on track, but I desparately need your help.  When I marry my fiance next year, I would every much like to have everything under control, and your assistance would help me to lower my overall interest rates, my monthly payment, and allow me to pay my debts and save for the wedding my girl has always wanted.  Thank you!<br/>
  Borrower added on 11/12/10 > Just as the title states I would like to have lower monthly payments. By combining my car payment and a few misc. accounts I have figured out that I could free up roughly 300 dollars a month, which I plan on saving toward a down payment on building a house. My job is very stable. I have been a registered nurse for the last 5 1/2 years. I work in the rehab dept. at a local hospital. I have been with my current employer for 1 1/2 years and prior to that I worked at a different hospital in rehab for 4 years. My husband is also in the health care field, so between the two of us we make more than enough to satisfy this loan obligation. My plan is pay this loan off in 3 years. I took the longer option for the lower payment, knowing that I can pay extra if I choose to do so. Thank you in advance to all who consider funding this loan. If there are anymore questions I will do my best to answer them in a timely manner.<br/> Borrower added on 11/22/10 > New plan for lower amount of funds to be received: <br/>Pay in full: chase credit card with balance of $2341.68<br/>Pay in full: century national bank with a balance of $4275.91<br/>Pay in full: aqua finance with a balance of $312.00<br/>Pay in full: remaining balance of my husband's sears card of $500.00 for a washing machine<br/>The remaining proceeds of $7340.34 will be applied to my auto loan with a balance of $7840.34 ( this loan will be paid off in January 2011.)<br/>Assuming that I make 60 payments of $395.00 on this loan I am debt free in 5 years at a total cost of $23,700.00, with a savings of $378.00/month. <br/><br/>I am already used to paying out $773.00/monthly now, so we apply that amount to this loan, which saves us $23,700.00 being paid back at $773.00/month, leaving me debt free in 30 months (2 1/2 years.) I then take that same $773.00 and invest if for 30 months, which gives me a savings, before any added interest, of $23,190.00. I will still come out ahead even if  my savings doesn't earn a penny of interest on it's own. <br/>Thanks to everyone who has funded this loan so far, and thanks in advance to anyone still considering funding this loan.<br/> Borrower added on 11/24/10 > I would also like to add that I have enough in my retirement account to pay this loan in full if need should arise, but would rather not go that route.

I will use the loan funds for home improvements to increase the value of my property and also dramatically reduce my heating and cooling costs for a long time to come. The loan is for installing a Solar Thermal HVAC system as well as adding a bathroom and bedroom to my home.  This loan will be used to help make a great investment that will payback for itself in terms of the savings to monthly utility bill (>$300) and the value it will add to the property. According to the NAHB (National Assoc of Home Builders), addition of a bathroom and bedroom can each add 10%-20% to a home???s value. In addition the Solar Thermal HVAC will also add value to my home. In total these improvements can increase the value of my home by over $40,000 this year.  I believe I am a good borrower because I am very well employed and poised for significant growth in my earnings over the next 2-3 years. I have a long and stable credit history for the most part. I plan to always pay more than the minimum payment, and expect to pay off sooner than the due date. My budget for payment will be between $700-$900 per month.

  588862 added on 12/09/09 > My husband (grant writer making 42k per year) and I (RN making 50k) are newlyweds with 11k in credit card debt at 24% average interest.  We are trying to consolidate our 5 cc's into one lower interest payment in order to simplify our finances and save a bunch on interest.  Your help would be greatly appreciated!<br/> 588862 added on 12/10/09 > I have looked at other loan requests with similar grades (B5) and amounts and have seen some other questions that were asked, so I will try to preemptively answer some now.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to pay off the combined credit card balances of my husband and myself.  These credit card debts were accrued while I was finishing up nursing school and unable to work to help out with the finances due to clinicals/rotations.  My husband and I moved from the East Coast to the West Coast to be near my family during this time, so all moving expenses/furnishings for the new house went on credit cards until I started working and we could afford to pay them back.<br/><br/>The current balances/APR's are:  4100 @ 20.74, 2844 @ 27.74, 1750 @ 24.13, 1700 @ 22.9, 1000 @ 20.24.  We are currently making fixed payments of 700 per month (200 on the first two cards, 100 on the last 3) on these cards.<br/><br/>Our combined take home pay is roughly 5700 per month.  Our expenses (rent/utilities/husband's 13k student loan @ 2.4%/car insurance/food/gas/budgeted miscellaneous) run 2800 per month.  We'd like to reduce our monthly payment on credit cards from 700 to <400 so we can start making a dedicated effort to saving to buy a house/have children in 12 months time and every little bit of extra money in the form of less payments would help.<br/><br/>I have already requested Lending Club to verify my income.  I am a Registered Nurse and my husband is a Grant Writer at a large national non-profit health and human services company.  Both of us love our jobs and are very stable in them.  However, if either of us were to lose our jobs unexpectedly, our professions are such that there are a plethora of other openings available.<br/><br/>I have never had a late payment on my credit cards or my now paid-off car payment.  If we do not get this loan, we will still pay off these cards within the next 2 to 3 years.  This loan, besides allowing us to put more money into an emergency/house/child fund now, would save us over $1,000 in interest this year alone, so it seems like a no-brainer to see if you all will fund us.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.<br/>

  Borrower added on 05/13/10 > The reason I applied for this loan was basically as a surplus/safety fund for my upcoming Wedding Preparations this Memorial Day weekend. Being an Indian by culture, we have a 4 function event and hence the expense itself is substantial (invitation as proof are included). I already have my finances in order and hence I was applying to this personal loan as a safety net or a backup plan. It is most likely that I would only need to use a portion of this $16,000 and hence I should be able to repay this loan very easily within 36 months. <br/>In such an important moment in my life, I am looking for your organization to help create a safety net for me so that my wedding preparations go smoothly! In return, I am willing to write a testimonial which you can use to attract other lenders<br/>B)	Explanation of medium Credit Score<br/>One of the reasons I have a medium credit score is<br/>1)	I have been in the country for last 7 years<br/>2)	I have been working for the last 3 years and graduated from college only in 2007<br/>3)	I do not own a home, but rent a apartment in the Chic Atlantic Station Lofts<br/>4)	I do not have a car loan, because I paid in Full for a 2000 BMW Z3 Convertible<br/>5)	My only debts thus far are my credit card debts, <br/>I implore you that please do not consider my lack of debt as a factor in granting me a loan, as this personal loan will not only serve to increase my credit score, but also build a relationship with your organization<br/>Below, I have outlined my credit worthiness and shown proof of my ability to pay off my debt in a timely fashion<br/>C)	Credit Worthiness<br/>I work for one of the top 4 consulting companies in the world, Deloitte Consulting LLP and I have been working for them for over 2.5 years now. From a earnings perspective, my Annual Gross Salary is known to you dollars. Hence, from an income perspective, I will be able to repay this loan very easily. Also, I am in great standing with my company and have been promoted 2 years ago and up for a promotion in 2 months which will increase my gross earnings by 20%<br/>

  Borrower added on 04/04/12 > home improvement<br>
The sole purpose of this loan will be to pay off the credit cards that have been hanging over my head for years. I have been a faithful customer and have never once missed a payment on a debt, but high interest rates have kept them nearly impossible to pay off. I got in trouble back in college before I knew what damage credit cards could do, and haven't been able to dig my way out. I recently cut up every credit card I had; this was an amazing feeling! I have a B.A. in Psychology and am currently employed by the state of Missouri as a Youth Specialist. I work in a moderate security treatment center to help rehabilitate young men who have had some trouble with the law. I love my job and plan to stick with it as a career. I also substitute teach for the local public school system on the days that I don't work at the treatment center, which is a nice bit of additional income. I hope to get rid of my credit cards so I can buy a house before too long. My girlfriend (soon to be fiance) would like me to have control over my credit situation before we move in together, so I am hoping this will be one of the solutions! Thank you so much!  Borrower added on 03/09/11 > One final note: I have watched Dave Ramsey's DVDs and am already following his suggestions. I used my tax return to pay off my two credit cards with the lowest balances. This loan will be used for the remainder. I will add about $75 to the minimum monthly payment of this loan, which is what I was paying on those other two. This should expedite the payoff process.<br/> Borrower added on 03/15/11 > Okay, another note: I had my student loan payments reduced and I will be throwing the difference at this loan as well, which should mean an additional $80 a month. Again, I am incredibly serious about getting rid of my credit cards. This needs to happen. Thanks!<br/>

At some point, I hope to qualify as an investor as well.  This is a wonderful idea especially in today's economy.<br/> Borrower added on 03/19/11 > Ok, here is more details on what this loan will be used for....<br/><br/>I will pay off all of my current debt with the exception of my mortgage loan.  I am currently renting my home to my brother with the hopes that he will obtain financing and be able buy it eventually.  I have quite a bit of &quot;roll up&quot; funds available to pay extra on my current debt and as I said earlier, my goal is to become debt free quickly.  Before paying extra, however, I need to use the extra funds to build the emergency fund needed to cover any unexpected expenses without using credit at all.  This is the &quot;3 to 6 months of income&quot; recommended.  I have recently &quot;paid off&quot; 2 bills and have used the extra funds to begin to pay off the next one on the list.  One of my creditors recently increased my interest rate for &quot;profitability purposes&quot; which baffles me as the big banks make so much money already.  With the new consumer credit laws in effect, the banks need to find ways of keeping their income at the levels they are used to and unfortunately this is also affecting some of the smaller community banks and credit unions.  I would rather pay any interest to personal investors as opposed to a select group of stockholders who do not know my situation, goals and plan for personal growth.  Another goal is to become debt free while at the same time increasing my credit score to above 800.  Being debt free to me will mean that I can make the kinds of choices that benefit my family and my community and will enable me to spend my time focusing on worthwhile projects without worry.  If the loan is not funded fully, I will continue with my current plan to become debt free (within 3 years, if not sooner)...This loan will help create momentum and peace of mind.  Thanks so much and please do not hesitate to email me with any specific questions that you may have.  I really hope that this works out because I see the potential benefits for both borrowers and investors with this type of program.

We have set a date of March 27, 2010 for our wedding. We have found a venue in Garland Texas where the ceremony and reception will be held. We have received an estimate of about $8k. This practically includes everything: the setup, wedding cake, groom cake, food etc.  A photographer, apparel and other miscellaneous expenses such as stationery are not included in the $8K.   As you will see, I work fulltime earning about $38K per year and my fiancÃ© earns about $35K per year. Thus, as a household, we will make about $70K per year. Also, my earning potential is increasing as I just graduated with my Masters (May 16) and will start a doctoral program on Monday, August 31, both at Texas A&M University, College Station.  Rather than placing this debt on a credit card, we are hoping to get approved for this loan and have monthly payments, to be paid in full over the next several months.  
  Borrower added on 10/16/12 > I want to consolidate my credit card loans into one monthly payment in offer to become credit card debt free!. A 36 month loan gives me a payoff date that is foreseeable and a payment that is manageable.<br>

I am looking to consolidate my credit card debt that is approx $20,000.00. Currently, I have 4 credit cards that are all under a 10%APR and I am able to make more than the minimum payments on each of them every month, but I don't feel like I am getting ahead. I am not making any new charges on the cards, and I feel I could be more motivated to clear off this debt by making one monthly payment to a loan rather then all these credit cards. Once I am approved for the loan, I plan on making monthly payments of $700.00 mimimum. Thus, I should be out of debt within 28-30 Months. I believe this is the best step for my financial future. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for your consideration.

Hello,  My company purchases items from suppliers and resell them to the government.  We currently have contracts with the US government, but now need capital to grow the business.  We will use the funds to pay our suppliers deposits for the purchased items and shipping.  When the government receives the items, they pay us.  We need the funds because there is a time gap from between when we need to pay the supplier and when the government pays us.  The risks are relatively low in our business because our client is the US government.  You can see the contracts we are working on here http://sites.google.com/site/taiwanjackllc/   This loan will allow my company to broker more contracts between suppliers and the government.

We're making the payments but can't get out - mostly because the interest rates on the AMEX credit card we have are so high.

I would like to borrow to make some improvements on a home I purchased during 2007.  I would like to build a fence and a deck, as well as update the kitchen.  I am not attempting to flip this house, so repayment would not be tied to the sale of the house.  It is my primary residence and I intend to live here for a long time.   My car is paid off and runs well.  I have a very few store cards (JCPenney, etc.) and bank cards that I use occasionally for discount puposes.  I pay those in full quickly.  Other than my mortgage and those few cards, I am debt free.

For now the lower payment will help out.  Thank You.<br/>
I'll be using this loan to payoff a Home Equity Line of Credit before my bank will let me refinance. The low-rate refinance option I'm looking at only allows 1 loan on the home so I need to payoff this Home Equity before I can finalize the refinance.  I've looked at other options like credit card cash advances or Balance Transfers but the fees are so high right now... and the payback times are only 6-12months  I've been in the home one and a half years and already the interest rates have dropped enough that by refinancing my current mortgage I'll be saving about $200/month  The home is a modest, single family home in Western NY (not a multi-million dollar mansion that I cant afford). Its valued at about $165k (the bank just finished the appraisal on March 17th, 2009), which is up 5% from when I bought it (yes ... the market here is increasing).  I've been employed at the same company since 2005, have excellent credit, and never make late payments.

 I am paying for my wedding on a less than ideal time line. My future father-in-law, who was planning on footing most of the bill recently lost his job.

  Borrower added on 10/20/10 > Hi, my name is Eric.  Two weeks ago, I proposed to the love of my life, Sarah.  She makes me incredibly incredibly happy... so the night before I proposed, I called her father to ask his blessing.  He said &quot;nothing could make me more proud than to have you as a son.&quot;  So, I took the plunge... wish us luck and send prayers our way!<br/><br/>Her family lives in California and mine lives in Kansas, but we both live in New York, so the wedding may get expensive.  Sarah and I both have great jobs (I work at Columbia University as a scientist working on international sustainable development, mostly on a project in Ethiopia, and she teaches High School earth science in Brooklyn with Teach for America) but neither we or our families have enough extra cash with the recession to afford to fly our most important friends and family to her hometown for a wedding.  So, when I heard about Lending Club, I was excited for the opportunity to help our wedding plans along.<br/><br/>I'll initially be using the money to pay off our American Express card ($7250 at 14.50%) and also to pay back a small loan my parents gave me ($2000).  We've also already used my frequent flier miles (from my work trips to Ethiopia) to buy trips home for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but those miles won't last forever.  The rest of the money will be saved for expenses that occur from now until our wedding date next fall and to offset money that our parents would otherwise have to pay.  Our parents have already done so much for us in our lives, and so this is one way we've decided to give back to them.  Since we can afford the extra monthly payments, I'd rather pay some of the wedding expenses ourselves rather than borrow more money from them.<br/><br/>Thank you in advance SO MUCH for any small help you choose to give us. =)<br/><br/>Many Blessings to you and your families-<br/>Eric and Sarah<br/> Borrower added on 10/21/10 > After discussing this loan with my fiance, we'd like to use some money from this loan to also consolidate some of her debt before the wedding (she still has about $6500 in debt from her younger college days... before she met me and decided to settle down) =).

I am trying to get a loan to consolidate eliminate unnecessary bills.  I have bills that accumulated while helping out family.  Helping family is always good if you are able to help.  I was so focused on digging someone else out and before I knew it I was in deeper.  I will use this loan to pay off a school loan, a medical bill and a couple of credit cards that have very small balances on them. After those are paid off I will only have to worry about paying my car payment and insurance, rent, and monthly expenses.  I have been employed full time without any gaps since 1998 (when I was 18).  I was active duty military from 1998-2006.  After separating from the military, I worked for a company for a little over a year and switched to a new company doing the exact same job and just recently I was offered a new position and I have been working there for a few months but I am still working for my old company as a part time employee.  I am more than capable of paying this loan back. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

My objective is to be debt free in three years.  I have a very stable job, working for Johnson Controls Inc.  In the past 10 + years, I have made a point to pay all my bills on time.  I have bought and paid off two cars in full with no late payments.  I have paid on a mortgage for almost 7 years now, and have never been late on a payment.

I have two credit cards that I want to consolidate into one monthly payment.  With my interest rates in the mid-20's, interest has been taking a toll on knocking the debt down in a timely fashion.    With Lending Club, I can cut my interest rate significantly, save money, and pay off my debt in under three years.  I have never missed a payment on my mortgage, car loan, or credit cards in the eight years of establishing credit.



  Borrower added on 01/14/11 > In June we used our first Lending Club loan to pay off a super high interest rate credit card, which had increased from around 13% to 29% despite no late/missed payments. We intend to use this loan to pay off that loan and further consolidate higher interest debt.<br/><br/>My husband and I both have excellent payment histories and five jobs between us. My income has risen slightly faster than inflation, and we recently slashed our utility bills 40% by switching electric companies. I am a good candidate for this loan because we continue to pay off and consolidate our debt. We have no problems paying our bills&mdash;no missed/late payments. We just want to pay them off faster and have fewer monthly payments. We&rsquo;re also planning on refinancing our mortgage to a lower interest rate (and payment) in the next 30-60 days.

The primary purpose of this loan is to help fund our wedding. A fair portion will go towards the ring and the rest will be spent on our trip to Hawaii.  We have been living together for the past 4 years and we both feel that it is time to tie the knot. It's either now or never.  I have stable employment working a desk job for a passenger transportation company for the past three years. I see a major promotion for me on the horizon.  She is a state-certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and has two more semesters before she earns her RN (Registered Nurse). Her projected starting salary in her new job is double my current income.  We do in fact have the cash on hand to fund the wedding without this loan, but would rather pay the interest and not pillage our rainy-day fund.  This will be my second loan with Lending Club. I paid off my first loan a few months early. At this APR, I do not intend to repay this one prematurely.  We attempt to live as frugal as possible. Cost of living in Arizona is rather affordable.  An example of our monthly budget is as follows: 650.00 Housing (2 bedroom apartment) 200.00 Sustenance 250.00 Transportation (2 economy cars, both paid for) 100.00 Entertainment 100.00 Shopping 120.00 Commuication (mobile phones, no land-line) 100.00 Savings (contribution to our emergency fund)  This budget is split between the two of us. My portion is only 760.00. If you add this loan, that brings my budget to just shy of $900.00 per month which is quite affordable for us. That is why I am a great candidate for your investment.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I will respond as quickly as possible. Borrower added on 01/20/11 > It looks like this loan is going to be 100% funded.

Because of my divorce, I ended up in a lot of debt going from credit cards to loans with Credit Union.  Borrowing money at a fixed monthly payment would the answer to my prayers.

I would like to increase advertising through yellow pages and billboards.  I purchased a business 3 years ago and it has almost tripled in that time frame.  My business is near a metropolitan area so advertising costs are expensive.  I want to take out a full page ad in the yellow pages of several books that distribute to our area.  Most businesses that are in competition take out full page ads.  I also want to obtain a new copier outright as the one I have is on a lease and expires in November 2007.  I want to try and avoid going the lease route again.  I am in the process of changing names from the original owner and want to promote the new name boldly with advertising.
I am requesting this loan to help me refinance and get a better interest rate so I can consolidate and repay my debt on a faster schedule. I am also going to use a small portion as startup capital for a small business I have on the side.

  I am a highly dedicated professional with vast experience and a Bachelor of Science degree in Elementary Education.  This loan will provide me the opportunity to further my education, consolidate some of my indebtedness and advance my career and income.   I'm extremely excited about my decision to accomplish my long awaited dream of obtaining my Masters degree in Psychology and Counseling.  Although I joyfully taught in the public school system for 23 years, my desire was always to be of greater service.  Most recently, I have practiced as a licensed Real Estate Associate Broker in Colorado.   Suddenly I have found myself divorced, financially challenged and responsible to a large degree for the care nurturing and well-being of my beloved 9 year old granddaughter.  Being of sound mind and spirit, I'm well aware that NOW is the time to take action, move forward in positive directions and create a bright future for myself and my little one.   As my teaching license expired in 2005, My immediate goal is to begin my Masters Program and reinstate my teaching license after completion of my first 6 semester hours, which will enable me to substitute teach while continuing my education.  As the opportunity arises I will also sell homes and vacant land to supplement my income while attending school.  Realizing that my requested loan amount may fall a bit short of financing my entire Masters, I am confident that I will be able to secure scholarships or grants to complete my degree program.  I hope to graduate within 18 months of enrolling.   Upon completion of my degree, my intent is to be employed as a school counselor within the public school system or practice family counseling with a private counseling service provider, thus increasing my income and ability to repay this essential loan.   In the long-term, my fondest wish is to establish a very special ranch, in my mountain home area, which will provide unique opportunities for handicapped children and adults alike, as well as services, facilities and respites for families in need.   I'm so grateful for your consideration and funding of my request.

Purpose of loan to consolidate debt under a lower interest rate.

I am a 55 year old female who returned to college two years ago. I earned a Technical Certificate in Office Technology and an Associates of Applied Science degree in Office Technology. My cummulative GPA is 3.845.  I want to remain in college and will pursue an Associates of Applied Science degree in Business Administration and a CST in Database Applications. Although I attended college full-time, I remained employed part-time. My earnings have risen from $19,242 for 2006 to $23,587 for 2008 commensurate with knowledge and the "Degree".  Information provided by the credit reporting agencies do not accurately reflect that I have been making Student Loan payments -  AES/NCT: "interest only" payments since 4/06 and full payment currently Loan to Learn: "interest only" payments since 2/2007. My monthly expenses are low.

Looking to enroll in my Masters degree courses in January and want to pay my tuition for the coming semester.<br/><br/>The good news: I will be getting reimbursement from my job when I complete the classes at the end of the semester. I have funds on hand monthly to easily make payments on this loan until then. However, I will still carry the loan after that because I will be enrolling in more classes in the meanwhile. Nevertheless, I will be paying this down as bonuses and tax refunds come in.<br/><br/>My credit card rate is 14% and so I am glad to beat that. Additionally, with the obvious surpluses in my budget I will be paying down the loan.<br/><br/>Mo.

I have an annual income of 48k and currently have no debt. Since housing prices have come down and the government is offering a 8k tax credit for first time homeowners, I figure now is the time to purchase my first home! However, I currently have little saved for a downpayment. With this loan, I will be able to put down the required down payment and pay closing costs on a 80k home. With my income and tax credit, I will have no trouble affording my loan payments. Thank You in advance for helping me purchase my new home!

I hold two credit cards, one with Chase and the other BOA. Three months ago both banks increased my interest rates on the cards from fixed APR's of 11.5% & 12.8% to variable rates over 18%! Since then I have been steadily paying the balances off at a rate of about $500 a month.  I have been in steady employment for over five years with the same company. I have about $13k in credit card debt which is in excellent standing, never late and always pay more than the minimum. I also just paid off a new car loan for my wife's car (free and clear) and my own transport was bought outright a year ago with no debt outstanding.  I would like to reduce the APR on the $13k credit card debt I have and therefore be able to pay it off sooner. Borrower added on 01/15/10 > The credit card debt was mainly from paying for my daughters wedding in August 2008 and not from irresponsible spending. With the recent rate hikes from the banks it means I will have to carry this debt longer, but I would really like it paid and done with within 3-years.<br/>

Any remaining will go into my bank account to guarantee even further that I will always have enough to make sure you get paid back.  If you are seeing those 3 delinquencies, and are reconsidering lending to me based on those ~ please know that I don't want you to feel concerned, and want to do whatever I can to make you feel safe about helping me out.  I've always had automated payments with pretty much any company I ever dealt with.  Those 3 times, I started out with a couple of different accounts with manual payments instead of the automated, which everything else was.  Because I was used to automated, I had difficulty remembering to pay those manually, thereby ending up with those 3 "more than 30 days late" on my credit report.  I have since switched those over to automated, and have never had a problem since.  As you know, re-payment for this loan is automated, which guarantees you will be re-paid.  And like I said, since I am on full time disability, my monthly income is in no danger of ending.  Not all that long ago, my credit score was 800...it went down a bit when I had those difficulties, but now I am completely back on track & am doing whatever I can to raise my credit score back up, hopefully to 800 again.  I hope I have answered any questions or concerns you might have;  I just want you to know that I am a safe investment, so you can feel secure about helping me take my next step up in life!!!

Dear Lenders,     I'm applying for this loan in order to pay off credit card debt that I accrued during my college years.  I had a full ride for academics as an undergraduate student; however, my Father was the sole provider in our family and he was laid off during my sophomore year of college.  He was no longer able to pay for my books and living expenses such as groceries.  In order to finish out my junior and senior year of college I had to go into credit card debt.  Upon graduating it took me three months to find a job- during which I defaulted on my credit cards.  After securing a job by the end of that summer (2004)- I have never missed a payment or been late.  However, due to the high interest rates (20% in some cases) it has been difficult to get these debts paid off quickly.  I am hoping to get a lower interest loan- that is only 1 payment instead of the 4 that I am currently making- in order to pay these debts off as quickly as possible.  I am wanting to return to school and get my MBA beginning in the Fall of 2009, so I am trying to minimize any expenditures. Please feel free to email me with any additional questions as to my request for this loan.  Thank you!
I am a 30-year-old Kindergarten teacher who just can't seem to get ahead.  I have worked at the same school for nine years so if it's reliability you are worried about....no need. In my early twenties, I managed to make EVERY mistake possible in terms of my finances and, now that I am trying to make up for those mistakes, I just can't seem to keep my head above the water. I always seem to fall just short of breaking even and I am hoping that someone who has fallen on hard times before is willing to put a little faith into me. I am also currently maintaining my parents old home while they are relocated to help a family member in need.  Every penny that I would have had has gone into this place and, now that it is time for me get back to my own surroundings, I have nothing to do so. With $6,000, I would like to do the following:  *Pay off my three credit cards (debts totalling 3,500).  *Help my parents paint this house so that it can be put up for sale and they can put their time and energy into their own personal issues.  I am not looking to get rich OR borrow more than I need.  I am also not interested in living beyond my means...I have definately learned THAT lesson the hard way.  What I need is to get all my  bad debt paid off in a way that is responsible and mutually beneficial.  Thank you.

This loan is meant to provide the feeling of "getting ahead" of the game rather than ending up in debt, which is easy to do.  $5000 goes to repaying a private loan while the rest will go towards buying a Laptop Computer, which I have never taken the leap to spend the money on.  However I recently got a great new job that involves Graphics and Web site design which I have a great interest in and a desire to be my best.  I will also be taking some classes to complete a couple of Certificates (each equates to a "minor" in college).  I will also put some money towards my credit card before that gets away from me.  2008 turned out to be an amazing year for me which proved the point, that you never know what is around the next corner...and at 51, I'm making an upward move in my workplace and I'm finding new life in an old place.

  Borrower added on 05/12/11 > I will be using the funds, should they be provided to me, in order to aid in paying off very high interest debtors, and as such saving money in the long run, as I plan to further my education and obtain a Juris Doctorate in the coming years. I am a good borrower, not only due to the fact that I pay all my bills and financial obligations on time, but also because I am a full-time Registered Nurse with a stable job at a leading hospital, a position which I have held for approximately two years. Due to this fact, I will be able to repay this loan in a timely fashion without any problems or hinderance. My organized and well-planned monthly budget allows for the timely payment of my bills, car financing, as well as my car insurance. Furthermore, I do not have to pay rent at the house in which I am residing currently, due to the fact that I do not own nor finance the home.  As such, I have no financial obligations to rent or utility payments. Thank you for your kind consideration of my loan request. Your contribution will be highly appreciated and used solely for it's intended purpose. Please feel free to contact me via this website should you have any further questions or concerns<br/>

I usually pay about $2200 per month towards my credit cards with no problem, and that is by choice.  I plan to purchase a house in the near future and it would be great to have my report show high available credit with very little consumption and two installment loans.  I am slightly thrown-off with my Transunion score.  I run all three reports every month and they all three show a score of 712. Thanks. <br><br> Borrower added on 12/10/11 > It looks like my original loan description did not post.  I plan to purchase a condo or house in the near future and would like to pay off my credit card balances, making my credit report and score more attractive to lenders when the time comes.  <br><br>I do not have any delinquencies and pay my bills on time with approximately $1600 remaining available every month.  Although my minimum monthly payments average about $170 per month, I pay roughly $2000 to $2300 every month with extra money left over.  I accrued some medical debt within the last two years.  <br><br>I used my credit cards to cover the medical expenses my insurance didn't cover.  I am in excellent condition now.  I am slightly surprised about the score Transunion gave me.  I have been running my three credit reports and scores monthly through Experian for the last year and my score always averages 725 - 739 for all three Credit Reporting Agencies.  When checking my credit report directly through Transunion, my score was lower.  <br><br>I am in the process of consolidating my student loans.  The consolidation should be complete by the end of December.  I am consolidating them, not for payment reasons, but to increase my credit score with less installment accounts showing on my credit report.  The student  loan payment is $161 per month and in good standing.  Consolidating the installments/loans will increase my credit score by approximately 15 points. <br>

My employer had gross revenue of over 70 million dollars last year even with the down economy. I am the senior employee in a small IT shop. My employer has no room to down-size my department.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower is that I pay my bills on time. I have one late pay showing on my credit report and that is due to a visa card with zero balance having charged me a yearly membership fee when the card was supposed to have been converted to a no annual fee card. I am still dealing with HSBC on a resolution to the issue. I will end up adding a statement to my credit report to explain this if it does not get removed from my credit report.<br/> Borrower added on 01/17/11 > Greetings and thank you for considering funding my loan. This funding will be used to start-up a home based business that will be secondary to my primary employment.

I am trying this P2P lending thing to try and raise some cash for some business expansion.  Our small business Sunny Day Online, maker of quality websites, has been growing steadily with clients in California, Nevada, and Louisiana.  We have outgrown our office space in our Garage/Extra Bedroom and are ready to move into small office space.  We are preparing to buy supplies such as printers, laptops, etc., in addition to having a cusion.  About Sunny Day Online:  I have been operating some form of Sunny Day Online as a hobby for over 10 years.  What started as a small side job has snowballed out of control into a real business.  We specialize in Web 2.0 like websites with Video, interactivity, etc.  I started to get serious about the business about a year and a half ago.  I decided that this is what I want to be doing with my life.  I brought on a partner and we have been working away ever since.  The great thing about web site design is that there is not a lot of overhead (at this point). Sunny Day Online will be as successful as we want it to be and we want it be extremely successful.  As I will personally gurantee the loan, you should know a little bit about me.  I daylight as an Associate Information Systems Technician for the State of California and have been working there for four years.  I work in desktop support at my day job with Attorneys and Secretarys from the California Department of Justice.  I am married, have no children, and my wife is a substitute teacher working on her credential to be a full time teacher. I am trustworthy and will repay your money.    Sunny Day Online has plenty of monthly cash flow to cover a loan of this size and as stated above I gurantee the loan personally and I also have the money to carry this loan.  I will not mess up the credit score I have worked so hard to build.  Last I checked it was 760.  I will eventually be looking to get a substantial loan if this experience is good one.  But for now I want to start small on these P2P networks and go from there.  Any takers?

The tax man put a lien on a financial account with more than enough money to pay off the lien.  They refuse to remove the lien unless the assessed amount is paid off first.  After many rounds of negotiations and hefty legal fees, the final settlement is about 10% of what they initially wanted.  Having to put off some bills and scrape off what I can, I am still $3400 short.  This is where you come in.  The settlement offer is good only until end of business next Wednesday, 6/17 so I can really use your help to fund the lien removal.  Once the lien is gone, I will be able to repay this amount in full, within 45 days.  Many thanks!

As the cost of credit has gotten more expensive, a couple of my credit cards, on which I maintain significant balances, have increased the interest rates as their cost of borrowing has risen. American express, for example, was at 6.99% last year, and has made 2 universal increases and now stands at 15.99%, even though my credit situation has not changed and I have never been late on any payments to any lender. This is a practice which it seems is becoming more common. For example, on Amex -  http://www.credit.com/forum/posts/list/339.page#1121 http://www.creditaddict.com/archives/american-express-amex-change-in-cardmember-terms-apr-rate-increases/ http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/american-express-c142633.html  I wish to avoid the random increases and consolidate at a lower rate. Also, the 3 year term and consolidated payment make it easier for me to manage.  I have a revolving line of credit from Bank of America which has available monies to consolidate, but again at a higher rate. I want to try this site, as it appears to be more cost effective.   I am a reliable person, as I've had no late payments on any account anywhere in my credit history. I take my credit rating very seriously and am scrupulous in my management and payment of my debts. For this reason, I am a good credit risk. My credit is perfect, although I do have a relatively high debt load as a result of student loans that I used to obtain my MBA.

Hello. My name is Roberto and I am currently a 24-year old medical student at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I am a kind and smart guy that is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon.  In the past (2006) I used Prosper to borrow money to fix up my 1971 Chevrolet Nova Muscle Car and was very pleased with the experience.  I borrowed $3,000 and paid it off in 12 months.  I am now seeking $10,750 to invest in U.S. equities and will be paying off my loan in 36 months.  I am an extremely hard working guy that was top of my class in college.  I am a very low risk borrower as I have NEVER been late on a credit card payment or peer-to-peer lending payment.  I have a lot going for me and will not risk messing up my credit or reputation by being late on any payments to a lender.  I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at http://www.pdsoros.org/current_fellows/   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over $23,000 in cash, all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around $30,000, owe $8000 on my credit cards (that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of $2500/month, I only use $1700 of it, does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score), go to medical school on a near full-ride, and have positive cash flow exceeding $800/month after all my expenses are taken into account.  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor.  Her income will cover groceries, gas, and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over $1100/month starting this fall. I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer.  You may ask why I have $8,000 in credit card debt when I have $23,000 in cash and $30,000 in assets?  That is because I have a 0% APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now.  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring, we have paid for the honeymoon, and our parents are paying for the wedding. I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0% APR deal ends I will pay the cards off.  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this $10,750 loan.   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities.  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing. This enormous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression, has left good companies (in infrastructure, tech, agriculture, shipping) trading at a fraction of what they were.  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every U.S. economic crisis in history.  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of $10,000 and turned it into $20,000 through learning to manage risk with stops, investing on a mixture of momentum, news, technical analysis, and fundamentals, not letting emotion, greed, or fear make me hold losing positions, learning to sell my losses and ride my gains, etc.  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 (2004 BMW 330Ci).  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon (next couple years) has once again convinced me to start to move some money ($5,000) back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already.  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan.

Hello Lenders:  I am seeking this loan as a means to consolidate my revolving debt into a single loan with a better rate over a fixed term. My goal is to eliminate my revolving debt so that my wife and I can then obtain a mortgage. More traditional financing options have shown no success, as we face a frustrating and ironic problem: We have too much revolving debt to obtain a loan to consolidate our revolving debt. As we are not home owners, we have no equity available to us.  We have a consistent and dependable payment history for much longer than the 2 years highlighted here. We have *NO DELINQUENCIES* during our 6 year history together. We each also have stable work histories, which is detailed below.  After looking at several other listings on this site, I wanted to preempt many questions that you may have, and have provided a summary of income and expenses. Once our revolving accounts are paid off, the majority of them will be closed. I know this may ding our credit score a bit, but we feel that we no longer need access to these lines of credit, and do not want to be tempted to put ourselves back into debt. I want each of you to be confident in your decision to fund this loan request, as it would provide my family the opportunity to take a big step towards realizing our dreams of home-ownership. I would to like to offer in advance my sincerest gratitude to each and every one of you that decides to contribute to my loan, and assure you that my family and I are a solid addition to your portfolio.   Combined Income: $60,000 (I have the W-2 to support this, and will submit it for verification as soon as my listing is approved.) I have been with the same employer for 4.5 years. My wife has been with her current employer since February 2008, and was with her previous employer from May 2000 to January 2008.   Expenses:   Car: NONE. She has a 2001, I have a 2003. Both are completely paid for. Rent: $550 Utilities: $200 Gas & Travel: $200 Groceries: $300 Entertainment: $200 Insurance: $250 Tuition and Educational expenses: $500 (No student loans, this is paid for out of pocket.) Credit: $500 (This would be approximately $515-$525 after using this loan to pay off our credit cards)  The majority of our debt is from 3 major sources: Our wedding, our combined educational expenses, and some medical bills.

  Borrower added on 09/23/13 > I would like to pay my car off and my American Express and a couple other credit accounts, like the &quot;Buckle&quot; and an old Capital One that I closed years ago, but am still paying it off.  I do like that this is a closed-end loan and not a revolving charge account :)<br>

  Borrower added on 03/01/11 > Funds to be used as start-up costs in opening an indoor/outdoor &quot;dog day camp&quot;, that my wife and I will be running. My history is as follows: 4 years with the U.S. Air Force, where I was trained in graphic design. I have been consistently employed as a graphic designer since exiting the Air Force in 1996. I have been with my current company (full time) since March 2001. My wife is also employed at a local dog boarding kennel since March 2008 as the manager. Her experience in animal care began in 1996, at a local veterinary hospital where she spent the next 9 years. Her exit from this location was amicable one, as she was offered to help another doctor open his 2 new practices. This took approximately 2 years, from there she was offered yet another venture of opening the kennel of a National pet store chain. After several years of working overtime for others in order to run their business's, we decided that she could have been working this hard to open her very own place. We are grateful for all the experience she has had in the blood, sweat and tears of opening a new business but we are ready to sweat for ourselves. I have no plans to leave my current full time job anytime in the near future, and my wife will be working at her current job, up until it is no longer humanly possible after opening our own location. This was not decided quickly or lightly, especially in these economic times. Thankfully, we remain employed and are able to pay our bills and mortgage on time. We've spent the past 8 months reading, researching and questioning other business owners in our area and have received excellent advice and feedback on our &quot;dream&quot; and we are ready to put her experience in the pet care industry to use. Please feel free to ask us any questions and thank you ahead of time for looking and considering!<br/>

  Borrower added on 06/02/10 > Eight years ago, I was rear-ended on an interstate highway by an uninsured driver.  It badly twisted my neck, and I have been in pain and in treatment by doctors ever since.  I have followed a conservative course of treatment to avoid surgery, but when I stopped improving last year, I saw a neurosurgeon and he recommended surgery if I ever wanted the pain to go away.<br/><br/>My claim against the insurance industry is still open.  I have not settled for two reasons.  One, I haven't finished treatment, and two, they have offered to settle for only $70,000.  That sounds like a lot, but it does not cover the financial damage of eight years of medical expenses that I have had to fund out of my own pocket.<br/><br/>I have been putting together my final set of documentation to submit, but Iâve reached the end of my claim period and to keep the claim open, I must file suit.  My claim is also against my own insurance company, whom I have been with for 30 years.  In the past they have always settled claims fairly, but none of those was ever a personal injury claim.<br/><br/>I have not been, nor am I now, represented by an attorney.  I don't agree with the personal injury contingency approach to settling an accident claim.  <br/>I need one now to file suit and to provide advice on a few key issues because of the push-back Iâm getting.  I have no intention of going to court, but I do expect to go to mediation. <br/><br/>I believe the claim is worth at least $100,000 and perhaps more.  Why do I believe that now?  From the research Iâve done and because of the Neurosurgeon report that will say that the  surgery is necessary.<br/><br/>Use of funds:  To cover attorney fees, filing fees, doctor's statements and mediation.  <br/><br/>Source of Repayment:  When the claim settles.<br/><br/>I will include a copy of the last offer from the insurance company to the Lending Club folks along with income information.  I am also willing to have a lien placed on the claim.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>

My company is Silver Lining Investment Properties LLC, and we have been in business since 2007 buying and selling residential houses.   We buy bank owned houses at .40 to .50 cents on the dollar and then resell them to retail buyers and investors for .80 cents on the dollar. It is great to see new home owners in an affordable house with pre-existing equity. Our company runs about 3 to 5 properties at a time.   Since the current credit meltdown our business lines of credit with two of our banks and loan programs have disappeared. We now need to reinvest most of our profits to fund any new properties we purchase, which is fine, but ties up a lot of our cash and is keeping us from expanding our business.   This loan would help us with a down payment on a great property deal in Portland, Oregon. We just had an offer accepted by Umpqua Bank for $225,000 and need to put 20% down to get financing or $45,000.  We are investing $34,000 of our own cash for the down payment and still need $11,000 to meet the 20% down payment requirement of $225,000. The property is valued at $399,000 which is very conservative market price; two comparables on the same street have sold for about $425,000 in the last 2 months. It is in a great neighborhood by great schools, and it is too good of an opportunity to pass up.  -The loan will be paid off in 6 months to 1 year, after the house is sold or refinanced.    Thank you for your consideration,  Michael Allen Silver Lining Investment Properties LLC Owner

The rate of interest and fees incurred by carrying a balance on my credit card are so outrageous at this point that continuing to pay them is patently bad financial thinking.  I wish to redirect my efforts at retiring my debt via another more-reasonable means.    I have sufficient funds to direct to this end on a monthly basis, and have simply gotten tired of their being gobbled up by interest and fees.





  Borrower added on 05/01/13 > To consolidate, and free up some money. Summer is almost here, and our kids would like to play baseball, football and soccer. Just trying to free up some stuff, to get them into their sports.<br>


In 2005, a friend (who later became my fiancee, though it didn't work out in the end) was diagnosed with cancer.  She had no medical insurance and Medicaid was insufficient.  Over the next couple of years, I spent over $100,000 assisting her with medical bills.  You'll be happy to know she's alive and well.  Unfortunately, at that time, I was making less than $60K a year.  After I burned through my savings, I accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in debt, most of it on credit cards (I had excellent credit then).  Needless to say, my debt level decreased my credit score by quite a lot.  After the catastrophe was over, I have continued to advance in my career and make payments on my debt.  While I'm making some progress, it's going very slowly and sometimes feels like I'll never be out of debt.  Still, over the past few years, I've greatly improved my credit by consistently paying on time and more than the minimum.  At this point, I would like to consolidate some of my debt into a simple lower rate interest installment loan rather than multiple compound interest revolving lines of credit at higher interest rates.  I'll continue to display the same tenacity in paying my debts on time, but now it will actually get me somewhere.

I have never been late on any payments, quicker and quicker I have been getting out of debt. My wife and I both teach and we simply want to refinance and get rid of our remaining credit card debt from college. We have 2 credit cards, this one and one with a $3000 balance. We have a repayment plan but we really don't want to pay 19% on this card. I figure if they are going to jack up my interest to 19% Id rather refinance and give the interest to actual people instead of corporations. Plus Ill get a better fixed rate. Please consider funding our loan and if you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks!

On a more personal level, however, there is no teacher like experience - and having accumulated the amount of debt that I have (&quot;righteous debt&quot; though it is - surgeries for my dog, framing for my photos for an opening, road trips to MI to see my family...) has taught me what a burden it is to be paying x amount of dollars to 5 or 6 different places each month...organization is not my strong suit - although I've somehow managed thus far. Anyhow, I have a true motivation to live debt free, or at least with a minimal amount. Streamlining my debt into one loan makes it so much more efficient and organized!<br/>

I would like to increase advertising through yellow pages and billboards.  I purchased a business 3 years ago and it has almost tripled in that time frame.  My business is near a metropolitan area so advertising costs are expensive.  I want to take out a full page ad in the yellow pages of several books that distribute to our area.  Most businesses that are in competition take out full page ads.  I also want to obtain a new copier outright as the one I have is on a lease and expires in November 2007.  I want to try and avoid going the lease route again.  I am in the process of changing names from the original owner and want to promote the new name boldly with advertising.

I am a sales representative for a US marketing company.  I have worked there for the last 8 years.  In February 2006, I started my own company doing consulting work for small and medium businesses.  To help cover the initial outlays for this venture, I have maintained my full-time job.  Keeping my full-time employment while building my business has made the experience significantly easier.  I have been able to invest a lot of capital into branding my company name and have not incurred the cash flow crunches faced by most startups.  I am looking to refinance the last of my debt.  After paying off this loan, I will be debt free.  I am a responsible borrower and have always paid my bills on time.  I do not have any late payments on my credit report.  I manage my credit very carefully and am logical in how I use my accounts.  I have a good percentage of credit available and am a dependable borrower.  I keep a comfortable cushion in both my checking and money market account and am well-prepared in the event of any unforeseen circumstances.  I have always made it a priority to plan for the future.  My car is owned free and clear, and I have no open installment or mortgage loans.  I currently live with my brother in a home owned by a relative, so my monthly housing expenses are minimal.

I am looking to consolidate 3 credit card vendors into one loan with a fixed interest rate. I am tired of the policies of the credit card companies, rate changes, fees, higher minumums, etc. I have 10,000 cash to settle any outstanding balances that this loan will not cover. Therefore, this loan will consolidate all unsecured debt with one vendor (Lending club). Once consolidated, I will then re-finance my mortgage from 7% to todays rates.

 559662 added on 10/19/09 > Hello there!  What can I say really, other than the fact that I'm trying to do some refinancing and debt consolidation....school loans, everyday bills....simplifying life!  I've got great credit (742 to be exact!), I pay my bills on time and have a steady job with the Army--good investment, no?  Besides, I'm cute and you can't pass that up! So do yourself a favor and throw some funding my way.  We'll mooch off one another for a while and come out on top in this crazy system called the national economy!  Thank you in advance--you're my hero :) 559662 added on 10/20/09 > I have been informed that the previous half of my loan description was not appropriate and after allowing myself a second of humiliation, I have decided that this person is right.  Therefore, I will leave a description that is actually honest and real because that's really all there is.    Frankly, this whole process--talking to banks, looking at various lines of credit and doing research--has been somewhat disheartening and what I previously wrote was a sarcastic, pessimistic version of that.  Most of my debt (as I'm sure is the case with many other borrowers on this site) comes from student loans.    Currently, I'm in grad school full-time and I work full-time which doesn't always seem to present well for banks.  However, I'm not your typical student.  I have excellent credit and I ALWAYS pay my bills on time, but I just happen to enjoy learning and have not reached the point in my life yet where my "ideal job" is attainable (doctorate here I come).    I wish I could say that I had the job and career (even kids) which would allow me to settle down, but I've still got a little ways to go before any of that comes to fruition.    As far as the military goes, they have paid for a decent portion of my education (which I am extremely greatful); however, anyone who is familiar with how Tuition Assistance works knows that they certainly don't pay for everything.    I can't complain, I've been given a great opportunity to continue my schooling and not everyone gets that chance.  Still, I could use some help because I desprately want to simplify the rest of my life by consolidating all of those loans into one place.   Thank you in advance.

Like many other credit card users, I had my three medium-rate cards shifted to maximum interest when the economic downfall hit banks and credit card companies.  My previous APRs of 9.99, 11.99, and 18.99 have been increased to 24.24, 29.99, and 29.99 respectively.  Having cut all frivolous/big travel/impetuous youthful spending out of my life (and physically cut up the cards themselves!), I am already on the right track to pay off all of my credit card debt entirely in the next few years.  However, the doubling of those interest rates has put an even bigger dent in my monthly payments.  I'm not having any trouble meeting minimums (I try to pay at least $100 more than the minimum every month), but paying $300+ per month in interest alone makes me feel faint whenever I think about it.  Also, I would like to buy a house sometime in the next 3-4 years, so getting my debt taken care of sooner than later has become the top priority in my life.  I have never lacked full-time employment and have been at the same job for the past 7.5 years.  Save one small medical bill nearly ten years ago, I have never been so much as a minute late with a credit card, loan, or bill payment. I would much rather have a private citizen earn money from the interest that I would pay on a personal loan than to keep shoveling hundreds of dollars into banks (TARP recipients, no less).  It would also be very helpful to automatically have one giant payment withdrawn on one date instead of having to schedule several smaller payments on different due dates. With my current financial situation, depending on the interest rate, I should be able to pay off this loan in a year and a half or less.  Thanks so much for any help you could provide with this request.

I have the opportunity to purchase my dream car. A beautiful 1968 Corvette Stingray convertible from a private seller. The purchase price is $26,000. I will be using my own funds to cover the difference.  The car needs a little work to restore, but with a bit of elbow grease would sell for twice as much (although I doubt I would sell it).   This will be a fun project for me as well as a good investment.   I have been self-employed for approximately 5 years in the internet marketing field, and prior to that, a craps dealer in numerous casinos in Las Vegas and Kansas City, off and on for almost 9 years.   My credit is impeccable, with a 771 FICO from Transunion and 780 FICO from Equifax.   I live very modestly and my only bill is my rent which is $220 month inclusive of all utilities. I live with my sister and her family, by choice, not necessity. I will have an insurance payment of around $150 per month for the car as well.   I don't use my credit cards very often, but when I do, I pay them in full every month.   Thanks for considering my loan request.  Bid with confidence, I pay my bills. :)  I will be verifying my income with Lending Club shortly.

  Borrower added on 10/31/11 > This loan is to invest in several needed resources to start an Internet marketing company which performs website development, SEO, email marketing, content management, and reputation protection to small local businesses. This is a hungry market and a proven business model. Local Internet marketing is on the rise because old media techniques are less effective, while most people are now finding businesses on the Internet. Small business owners need help navigating this type of marketing because it is technical and there is a learning curve. We take care of that part and let the business owner focus on what they do best. We have been developing this business over the course of a year with assistance from three Internet marketing veterans who serve as our coaches.<br/> Borrower added on 11/05/11 > We get our customers by meeting with business owners directly and  building rapport as we discuss the needs and concerns of the owner. We don't wait for people to find us, we go to them. However, we don't try to sell anything. There are no hard sales tactics. We simply build a relationship based on mutual interests and a desire to help where we can. It is only after this initial phase that we offer to do the work that piqued their interest the most.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/11 > Another important part if our business is working with local businesses to integrate social media into their marketing. B2B companies must utilize LinkedIn, for instance. Facebook is more appropriate for business to customer relationships. In addition, there is YouTube, Twitter, and GooglePlus. We help define up the best strategy for the particular company. We then set up the necessary accounts and teach our clients how to use their social media accounts. Alternately, we will manage these accounts on behalf of the company. Participating in Social Media can be time-consuming, but it is also crucial. Thus, we offer to manage a company's social media profiles. <br>

We have been using credit cards to finance the move and supplies and now want to consolidate everything into 1 single payment. We always pay on time and I have a full time job as well - bringing in more than enough income to cover the monthly expenses despite the success of the business. I'm pretty low risk...with a 705 FICO score as of 11/7/2010.<br/> Borrower added on 11/08/10 > This year, our home based business has generated $70K in sales...of which approximately 60% was profit due to the low overhead we have working out of the the home office. Can proviide our business plan and P+L for those truly interested in lending the money to expand. We have a steady and growing list of clients in St. Augustine, FL and have been adding many new services over the past year that are gaining traction. Again, this is as low risk for any investor as I can imagine...being that I make appx. $80K a year outside of the business, more than sufficient to pay off this loan in the allotted time. Together, our income is above $125K - give or take.<br/><br/>Our new location is in the Medical District of St. Augustine and our target market is the medical base of our community, which, if you acknowledge that health care is booming, this minimizes the risk even more!<br/><br/>We're a safe bet...<br/> Borrower added on 11/12/10 > Special thanks to those who have determined us to be a safe investment...you will not be let down!<br/><br/>As for where we are:<br/>Today, the flooring and server were installed. My husband has already sold 11 remote backup services which account for our monthly rent. Whoohoo, not debt there!<br/>As for the loan, there is still a considerable amount remaining, so I decided to let you all know what it will be used for...<br/>1. Payroll...we always paid contractors and sub-contractors, now we have staff and need to ensure that the money is in our account to do so. Currently we have 1 year of salaries in the bank...<br/>2. Credit Card payments: We have funded about 40% of the expansion using credit cards totalling less than $20K. While about $10K is no-interest credit, the other $10K is not and will be paid with the funds we are requesting.<br/>3. Our monthly debt for business is about $800 for everything - excluding salaries and new equipment. We are already prepaid on the rent 6 months out and plan to pay this way for the duration of the 5 year lease.<br/>4. There is a small amount of money going towards a leased car for the business, since we travel quite a bit. A vehicle wrap is being installed for marketing purposes...this is being done by my husband to reduce costs.<br/>We are about $13K short of our goal...please feel free to send me any questions you have...would like to close this chapter up and get moving with the &quot;making  MORE money&quot; part ASAP.<br/>

If he gave me just 5 more months to pay I would not need this money at all. As you can see I am in a bind--a good one-land has skyrocketed in Brazil and now that the world cup in 2014 and the olympics in 2016 the land will easily double again in the next 5 years--I have it up for sale for  1,600,000 reais which is approx. 900,000 U.S.--The buyer of this property will make a fortune whether they landbank or develop it.Also the dollar keeps going lower against the Brazillian Real and my forecast is that it drops another 30 percent giving the buyer an additional discount in currency exchange.Also,a large Norwegian resort just a short 8 minute walk from me is 80 % sold and the small condos start at 200,000 each--huge profits in building and developing.

 Looking for a loan to pay off 2 of my credit cards and make one monthly payment to pay off.  
I would like to refinance my Mastercard whose interest rate is currently very high. I usually have about $1500 set aside for debt servicing after all my bills are paid and I have set aside some for monthly expenses but find a large amount of it is going for fees.  I would like to refinance all my cards (1 more with a 6K balance) but find that there is a limit of some sort. So I am willing to bring down the amount requested to about $5K and once I pay that off then I can borrow another 5K which will finish it out in my opinion. My other card has a 0% balance currently so I can use the freed up funds to pull the balance down on that considerably.  After that, I plan to channel those funds that I had set aside for debt servicing to lending on this network. Looks like a really cool concept...

I am starting my own law firm. I cater to people who cannot afford to pay $250 per hour but still deserve excellent representation. I already have six(6) cases/clients for my firm. There are various resources required in the practice of law that I simply cannot afford at this time without a loan. I want to provide the best representation possible but this means the appropriate resources, including but not limited to, fax/copier/printer/scanner; legal billing system; incorporation costs and fees; legal search engine subscriptions; legal malpractice insurance costs; and subscriptions to programs which help to obtain new clients. Ultimately I need a foundation from which to begin and that foundation is money. I am not attempting to be a non-profit. I simply want to serve those in the middle to lower socioeconomic classes (and small independent businesses) that share the same legal problems, if not worse, than those in higher socioeconomic classes. While at the same time I also need to survive. Obtaining this loan would help me get a jump start prior to bringing in a profit. I do hope you can help.

I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and earned an M.B.A. at the University of Phoenix. I did additional graduate work at the University of California at Santa Barbara and also attended Stanford University on a fellowship. I have worked as an executive in the life sciences and high-tech industries and have also taught at local universities.   As a professional, I have a proven track record. I co-founded a biotechnology company in a two-car garage, merged it with a larger firm, took the resulting company public and finally sold it to a major pharmaceutical company. Recently, I have been working as a business development consultant for the biotechnology and high-tech industries and would like to expand my consulting business, which focuses on using intelligent systems to help businesses gain a competitive advantage.  I seek a loan to avoid taping my investment account or personal savings. I will use the loan to purchase some additional business development tools such as upgraded software and hardware for my computer systems. Further, I wish to enroll in some educational programs so that I may take my business to a higher level.

Banks tend to raise the interest rates however they please (this is no secret now because of the recent collapse of the economy). I am very punctual and have never been late on any accounts.

I am looking for a loan to roll my credit card debt into one monthly payment and lower my interest rate.  I also would like a fixed term so I know when my loan is going to be paid off.


  Borrower added on 09/10/13 > I just bought a house a year ago. Of course like many homeowners know problems always arise. I have a few small but important things to fix that just popped up.

  Borrower added on 02/20/11 > One year from now, my boyfriend and I are planning to open a yoga studio business.  We plan to get an SBA loan for $50,000 and put $10,000 of our own money into the business.  We currently have $3000 cash saved.  We have no credit card debt.  I have been a server/server trainer at SteakNShake since early December of 2009.  I make around $10/hr in combined hourly wage and tips.  I work around 24 hours per week.  My boyfriend is a yoga instructor and manager of a yoga studio.  He takes home $850-$870 every 2 weeks.  We take home $2800-$2900 per month.  Our monthly expenses are about $2280 per month, so we are able to save $520-$620 per month.<br/><br/>We bought my FICO scores a couple of days ago.  My scores are 769 and 757.  We have a business plan and 5 year projections for the yoga studio.  I am going to community college full time, and I will receive about $1000 for living expenses from the college.  We get back around $6500 from taxes since we have two small children. <br/><br/>In the next 12 months we plan to save $520-$620 per month ($6240-$7440 over 12 months) and also save next year&rsquo;s tax return money and the extra college money (another $7500).  So without a loan, we plan to have our current $3000 plus another $13,740-$14,940.  That makes $16,740-$17,940 saved 12 months from now.  <br/><br/>We read the Lending Club prospectus and looked at their requirements and how they handle loans.  We like the fact that they are up-front about how they calculate interest rates and select worthy borrowers.  The extra $7350 loan we are requesting (or $7130 after closing fees) will enable both my boyfriend and I to quit our jobs about a year from now for a few months in order to start the yoga studio in a financially safe and conservative way.  Our loan payments through Lending Club will be around $230 per month.  This loan will allow us to have a little over $20,000 saved in the next 12 months.  The installment loan will look good to the SBA as we make consistent, timely payments.  We will then put $10,000 cash into the business, request a $50,000 SBA loan with a solid business plan, and have another $10,000 available to pay over 4 months of living expenses while we start and grow the yoga studio business.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration.<br/>

I just needed to get the loan to begin with!<br/> Borrower added on 06/23/10 > In addition to my weekly paycheck, I also have an additional income in the four figure range. With this income though, it is not on my tax return. It is part of a trust fund account that I have. This is the money that reassures me that I will have no problem repaying this loan.  Nine years ago, I had a really high credit score. Misfortunes beyond my control threw me a curve ball. I have since gotten my credit score back up to a decent number. My credit score is very important to me. Repaying this loan is very important to me. I am so glad I came across Lending Club and their investors.<br/>

I have a very healthy monthly cash-flow, and I will be able to comfortably pay on my loan each month. I plan on using 100% of the funds to invest in precious metals. I am hard-working and dependable in nature and have a masters degree in mechanical engineering (magna cum laude for both my B.S. and M.S. in engineering). I have always paid my CC bills, utilities, rent, etc. on time. I have a very stable job at an Automotive Research and Development Facility. At work, I have short-term and long-term disability coverage, plus over $500,000 worth of personal accident insurance, so if I were to have any set-backs, I would still have plenty of monthly cash-flow. I greatly appreciate the fact that we can help better each other's futures! 
Thanks for considering my loan  I am requesting this loan in order to consolidate my debt and also to do some improvements to my recently purchased home.  I was a long time renter and finally decided to take the plunge and buy a house.  The house is comfortable and livable but it is over 80 years old and requires some work in order to nip some problems in the bud and prevent them from becoming bigger problems.  The house needs new windows and vinyl siding, for example.  I would use the extra money to pay off my credit cards.  Over the course of the past year I've put a lot of charges on my credit cards related to fixing up this house.  It would be a big relief for me to pay off my cards and make one set monthly payment.  I have a stable job working at the University of Pittsburgh as a Laboratory Technician that I've been at for 19 yrs.  I am very credit worthy and have never been late with any payment that I owe.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.

I just bought a new house and I have a bought a cheap little car to drive everyday.  Now I would like to pay off everything else and consolidate everything into ONE payment.

After considering my options, I prefer to simply get a loan that will pay them all off, chop the cards up into little pieces (except one), and be credit card debt free in less than five years.  The payments I'm making on my cards now are significantly higher than what my monthly payment on this loan will be, so I also anticipate paying this loan off sooner than the five years.

Any remaining will go into my bank account to guarantee even further that I will always have enough to make sure you get paid back.  If you are seeing those 3 delinquencies, and are reconsidering lending to me based on those ~ please know that I don't want you to feel concerned, and want to do whatever I can to make you feel safe about helping me out.  I've always had automated payments with pretty much any company I ever dealt with.  Those 3 times, I started out with a couple of different accounts with manual payments instead of the automated, which everything else was.  Because I was used to automated, I had difficulty remembering to pay those manually, thereby ending up with those 3 "more than 30 days late" on my credit report.  I have since switched those over to automated, and have never had a problem since.  As you know, re-payment for this loan is automated, which guarantees you will be re-paid.  And like I said, since I am on full time disability, my monthly income is in no danger of ending.  Not all that long ago, my credit score was 800...it went down a bit when I had those difficulties, but now I am completely back on track & am doing whatever I can to raise my credit score back up, hopefully to 800 again.  I hope I have answered any questions or concerns you might have;  I just want you to know that I am a safe investment, so you can feel secure about helping me take my next step up in life!!!  Thank you so much in advance for your help!!!

Hi there! The purpose of my request is to allow for consolidation of my existing debt. The amount I am requesting will be used to payoff balances and consolidate to one payment as it would be a lot easier to manage and pay down faster as a whole. I am a great candidate for this loan because I have excellent repayment history (never late), established credit history (11 years), a good credit score, gainfully employed and also have a side business. I have used my credit responsibly and would like to paydown my balances as I look to the future.  I would rather go with peer to peer lending as I believe the interest rates are better. Also, I would rather give back to individual investors than banks because I now believe this is a better way to do business.

I'm so sick of the banks and financial industry having all the power. That's why "Damn the Man".  The short story is after dealing with a computer error on my Home Depot payment,  (Citi Bank) which they owned up to and admitted there were some glitches, my payment posted late by less than 24 hours. They so conveniently raised my rate to the default of 29.99%. When I inquired and tried to get my rate reset, they said they have no control or ability to do that.  I've never had such a bad experience with any other company or my other Citi accounts.  I only need 2666.00 to pay off the Depot account, it's already been closed, I'm done with them. The balance will be used to consolidate 1 other card that is at 17%, about another $1750.00.  The remaining be paid back to lending club early, at this point I have no need for it, my remaining credit accounts are all at reasonable rates. FYI, the credit score listed is incorrect, I have CreditSecure with American Express and my combined Fico score as December 1st was 703, down from 730 over the last year  because my balances on a couple cards increased for business use and has not been paid down yet. I am self employed, my company is 2.5 years old and solid. We due, however have a fairly high overhead presently and are trying to reduce our existing CC debt which we used for start up and operating capital for the first 6 months. I welcome questions.

  Borrower added on 07/17/10 > The purpose of this loan is to consolidate all of my outstanding credit card debt into one simple monthly payment.  All proceeds from this loan will be used to pay off credit card balances.  In addition, I will be terminating all unnecessary credit accounts to restore balance to my debt-to-income ratio.  <br/><br/>I would consider my employment to be stable and expect it to remain stable beyond the 36 month duration of this note.  Next month, my gross salary will increase by $3,600/year as a result of a recent promotion, bringing my yearly gross income to $100,000, plus incentive bonuses.<br/><br/>Net Income per month: $4,600<br/>Average Expenses per Month: $2,600<br/><br/>Obtaining the funding for this loan would greatly help to simplify my monthly expenses and focus on eliminating all of my bad debt.<br/>
The purpose of this loan is to reduce monthly credit card payments and in some instances payoff the debt while continuing current investment strategies as advised. Additionally, the loan will allow me to build up the much needed 6 to 12 months of emergency reserve funds.

None of these cards are being used currently, nor will they be used again. I needed them at a very difficult time when my finances were not as good. However, I have a positive cash flow each month and do not rely on the cards.<br>
Loan Request:  I am a full time real estate investor. With the drought in financing to acquire homes I have lately been buying mobile homes located in mobile home parks with cash and renting them out.  I buy the mobiles with my cash and rehab them. Once the home is completed and filled with a tenant or tenant/buyer I obtain a private lending loan to recover my cost and to move on to the next project.  This loan would cover my acquisition and rehab cost for the property. The tenant pays a weekly rent of $120 a week. The lot rent is $170 a month. This property cash flows approximately $350 a month averaged out over the course of a year leaving plenty of room for a loan of $5000.  My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.  My private money website for the single family homes is located at http://www.privatedollar.com. My management company's website is located at http://www.picksimple.com.  Please note that my credit rating may seem risky however in general my score is most affected by my debt to income. I have several mortgages on my report in addition the income on my tax returns being lower due to the number of deductions I take from my business so please keep that in mind.  There are no late payments and I can provide references of private lenders who my local area who will verify my timely payments and also references of lenders who have loaned me money before and that I have paid off.  Thank you and I look forward to working with you.  Sincerely,  Michael Shane Wilson

  Borrower added on 11/03/10 > I have a lot of credit card debt that was primarily incurred by my deadbeat ex-husband. I got &quot;everything&quot; in the divorce, meaning all of the debt, including his student loans because we consolidated our loans. Servicing that debt was initially manageable because of my perfect payment history and some good teaser rates on balance transfers. Then, in anticipation of financial reform the interest rates on my cards shot up. Additionally, the credit lines were slashed, so my credit utilization ratio went up, causing my FICO score to go down. Then a number of teaser rates expired, and I was hardly making any progress on getting the debt under control due to crushing interest rates. <br/>When the financial reform finally kicked in, and the banks were required to apply credit card payments to the balance with the highest interest rate after satisfying the minimum payment, I started getting back on track. In the past 2 years I have reduced my credit card debt by almost half. I continue to cut expenses, live off of cash, and chisel away at the debt as much as possible. <br/>Happily, Chase and Bank of America are out of my life. Now the focus is on American Express, which despite my perfect payment record has a high interest rate and reduces my credit line every time I pay it down by a few thousand dollars, so it looks like I always have the card maxed out even though I haven&rsquo;t made a charge on that account in 4 years. This loan will allow me to move Amex debt to a lower fixed interest rate. I can&rsquo;t wait to get out from under Amex&rsquo;s thumb!<br/>I have practiced law for 13 years and am a partner in a 5-attorney (3 partners, 2 associates) boutique transactional law firm. Despite the economy our business has thrived for the past 2 years thanks to our oil &amp; gas practice, which is booming. All indications are that we will have plenty of O&amp;G work going forward. Meanwhile, our commercial real estate practice, which has been languishing, is starting to pick up and I anticipate that workload will steadily increase. We have recently started working on raw land acquisition for developers of single-family subdivisions. That work was the first to die off when the economy went bad, so I think this new activity bodes well for the recovery here in Texas, which was never as hard-hit as most of the nation. Housing will spur retail development, and industrial and office will follow that. We&rsquo;re even seeing some significant commercial lending. I feel very fortunate to be in the position of anticipating growth in our business while so many others are suffering. <br/>Bottom line, my interim goal is to get all of the remaining debt down to the lowest interest rate possible and ideally off of credit cards completely. I would rather pay interest to Lending Club investors than the companies who have made my life miserable the past 4 years. My overall goal, of course, is getting out of debt altogether so I can start investing in Lending Club loans myself.<br/>

It took me two years out of college to find a decent paying job in my field of study.  In those two years, I had a few jobs which didn't pay particularly well and a few months of unemployment.  I relied too heavily on credit cards to fill the gaps when my job wasn't enough.  Before I knew it, I was buried in credit card debt and the rates on the majority of the debt had more than doubled.  I have since found a secure job in my field of study (which I have been at for almost two years now) and have learned to budget and stop using/relying on credit cards.  However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.  I'm still young but I'm starting to think of my financial future and I'm confident this is the first step.

They were there for 4 months and due to hurdles and delays they had to come home for a a month and a half without her.  The hurdles have been overcome and are now ready to go back to finalize the adoption and bring her home.

That loan was taken out for adoption expenses as well two years ago and my son makes the payment on that loan.

Hello,  I am a 40 year old single women who over the past year has accumuliated some credit card debt that I would very much like to conlidate.  I have been employeed at the same company for 14 years and have a well paying job. I have approached the credit unions that I belong to over the past years and have always been put off and told they don't really help with these types of situations or just told no, but thanks for doing business with us. I find this very frustrating and dissappointing. While some may not think this is much debt, I find it overwheleming and uncomfortable, I would very much like to consolidate my debt so that I need only make one payment...and pay this off and then move to saving my money for retirement.  Thanks for your time and consideration.  Tracey

  Borrower added on 08/18/10 > Thank you in advance for your consideration.<br/>I have spent years building great credit but have gotten used to over spending. I have not missed a payment to any of my creditors on over 5 years. I am now seeing that my creditors are raising my APRs and it is harder to make the minimums.

I graduated from veterinary school almost one year ago and after 8 years of a brutal class schedule, little sleep, and no money, I am finally living my dream! Despite an excellent credit rating (and finally, an income!) I have $240K of student debt and almost every last cent I make right now goes to rent and loan payments.     My OTHER big dream is to have my own home!     I'd love to turn that rent money into mortgage money as soon as possible. I don't have quite as much for the down payment as I'd like to have. I've been pre-approved by the lender, and would rather not have to wait another six months of saving money in order to be able to make this investment.     I could do this through the bank but perhaps could get a better interest rate and more personal service through YOU!       
  Borrower added on 08/16/10 > Hello!<br/>My monthly budget pay-out is approximately $2680, which includes mortgage, utilities, insurance, and credit card payments. My bring home pay each month, including child support, is $3200. Currently, I have $20 taken from each pay check and put into a saving's account and my bank also offers a saving's system which transfers $1 from your checking into saving's for every transaction. In a typical month I can save about $120 between the paycheck deductions and the transaction transfers. <br/>My approximate balances and APRs for credit cards are:<br/>$923  - 29.9%<br/>$2510- 27.9%<br/>$1825- 29.9%<br/>$2081- 26.9%<br/>$1371- 24.9%<br/>$954-   19.1%<br/>$619-    9.9%<br/>$1864- 0% for one year<br/>Unfortunately, a few of these credit card debts ($1864- 0%, and the $1825-29.9%) arose from having a pet with a serious medical condition who died after the $1864 stay at the animal hospital. The rest of the debt was more bearable prior to the last 6 months of medical problems with the dog. <br/>In the last year, I paid off 2 other credit cards and have not used them since then, I didn't close out the accounts because I was told it looks bad on your credit report, so they are just not in use. The rest of this debt I plan on paying off prior to the 5 year payment plan that I chose for this debt consolidation loan. <br/>I am the sole wage earner in my household as I was recently divorced and, unfortunately, the one who kept the debt. This is why it is imperative for me to find a way to reduce my monthly expenses by consolidating these high interest credit card payments. I have two children to care for and plan for their futures, with this credit card debt it is difficult for me to provide for them and save for their futures at the same time. <br/>I am only requesting 8k for the consolidation because the other debts that I owe have lower interest rates than what was offered through the initial loan application process, and I plan on paying off the interest free one when I receive my tax return. <br/>Hope I answered all of your questions!  :)<br/>

I am one of the unlucky people that Chase decided to increase 5% of my total balance as my minimum fee. I have been with Chase for over 10 years and had no issue paying them more than the minimum balance fee. I never missed a payment since it is auto deducted from my checking account.   I was one of the few that got suckered into their balance transfer scheme. I transferred into Chase for their 3.99% until the life of the balance.  I decided to balanced transfer $25,000 and pay $750 per month so that I can finish within 3 years.  Now almost 7 months into the deal, I have to pay Chase $1250 per month due to their 5% increase.  They told me I have a choice, either play $1250 per month, close the account and pay in full, or take the 9.99% APR hike instead of the 3.99% APR.  This is why I need your help. I want to transfer all my remaining balance and get rid of Chase and their devious plan to exploit on unfortunate consumers. This is an outage and everyone who are with Chase should file a class suit.  I hope you undestand my situation and thank you for all your help and support.

I am looking for a loan to roll my credit card debt into one monthly payment and lower my interest rate.  I also would like a fixed term so I know when my loan is going to be paid off.



 I have recently had my truck and motorcycle break down, for which repairs cost almost $2000.  On top of that my cat was recently diagnosed as diabetic, and the vet bills and prescription costs are well over $700 and growing.  I really just need some extra money since these things came up at this time, to help me get through the holiday season, then I should have no problem paying off the loan in full.  All these extra expenses just popped up at a bad time for me.







I have had some unexpected expenses which have left me short on cash to cover my basic living expenses. This money is to recover that deficit while I work to cut my monthly expenses to make up for it.

While in College I racked up about 10,000 in credit card debt. In my first year of working I have paid off about 4000 of that amount. Everything was going fine until just recently when my largest credit card which I had just transferred another balance onto decided to raise my rates almost twice as much as what they were before. I am done arguing with these people and I am now interested in paying them off and getting them out of my life forever. Whatever money I can borrow will be used immediately to pay off all of my credit cards. I have about 5000 in a 401k plan which I can always fall back on if I lose my job / end of the world scenario.

We rent various locations: schools, dance studios etc. to hold small classes in Spanish, French and Chinese for children ages 1 - 7.  This business has been very successful in San Francisco, where it began and now has locations throughout the country.    Although I am a first-time business owner I have been teaching for many years and have a M.A. in French Literature. I have never defaulted or been late paying my student loans and my husband and I own our own home and 3 cars, 2 of which are paid off.  My credit history is stellar and you can be confident that this loan will be paid off quickly and that my gratitude will be priceless.  In addition, I intend to donate 10 percent of my business' profits to local schools and charities.

Obviously a lower rate like the one you have offered would allow me to pay off that debt a whole lot sooner.

My mother works very hard but thus far has been able to get a loan on her own. Additionally she is too proud to accept direct help from me, her son.

I&rsquo;m also trying to keep my mother from having to use the loan sharks which will charge her 30%+ interest rates. Thank you for helping and be assured this loan will be paid back in full plus interest while helping out someone that wants to do it the right way, is not looking for a handout but simply a helping hand.<br/> Borrower added on 08/09/10 > Thanks to everyone that has helped fund this account thus far. A couple of notes to add.<br/><br/>To be clear while I&rsquo;ve worked for the current employer directly for 2 years but I&rsquo;ve actually worked with the company for 9 years just through another party.<br/><br/>My mother actually owns her home outright but cannot find anyone that will do a home equity loan on it because technically it&rsquo;s considered a single wide trailer, it is in fact not (was expanded twice since 1996) but because the deed says that it is no one will lend her money.<br/><br/>Finally I have completely clean credit history, no missed or late payments, no bankruptcy, etc &ndash; in fact the only reason my credit score isn&rsquo;t A++ is that last year Bank of America pulled all my lines of credit during the credit crunch, this made it appear as if I suddenly maxed out of credit which is not the case. They closed all my open lines of credit and cut my credit limits on my other accounts to just above what I owed, so overnight I went from about 38% usage of credit to 91% usage of credit. Apparently this is not uncommon, BOA did this to a lot of people last year without any cause &ndash; and to make it even better they then used the high usage of credit as justification to raise my interest rates (from 9% to 18% in one case). My point in explaining this is that apparently this happened to many more people than myself which has forced us to find alternative routes for borrowing money.<br/><br/>Hopefully this additional information helps answer any outstanding questions.<br/><br/>Thank you again.<br/>

At some point, I hope to qualify as an investor as well.  This is a wonderful idea especially in today's economy.<br/> Borrower added on 03/19/11 > Ok, here is more details on what this loan will be used for....<br/><br/>I will pay off all of my current debt with the exception of my mortgage loan.  I am currently renting my home to my brother with the hopes that he will obtain financing and be able buy it eventually.  I have quite a bit of &quot;roll up&quot; funds available to pay extra on my current debt and as I said earlier, my goal is to become debt free quickly.  Before paying extra, however, I need to use the extra funds to build the emergency fund needed to cover any unexpected expenses without using credit at all.  This is the &quot;3 to 6 months of income&quot; recommended.  I have recently &quot;paid off&quot; 2 bills and have used the extra funds to begin to pay off the next one on the list.  One of my creditors recently increased my interest rate for &quot;profitability purposes&quot; which baffles me as the big banks make so much money already.  With the new consumer credit laws in effect, the banks need to find ways of keeping their income at the levels they are used to and unfortunately this is also affecting some of the smaller community banks and credit unions.  I would rather pay any interest to personal investors as opposed to a select group of stockholders who do not know my situation, goals and plan for personal growth.  Another goal is to become debt free while at the same time increasing my credit score to above 800.  Being debt free to me will mean that I can make the kinds of choices that benefit my family and my community and will enable me to spend my time focusing on worthwhile projects without worry.  If the loan is not funded fully, I will continue with my current plan to become debt free (within 3 years, if not sooner)...This loan will help create momentum and peace of mind.  Thanks so much and please do not hesitate to email me with any specific questions that you may have.  I really hope that this works out because I see the potential benefits for both borrowers and investors with this type of program.

To all:  I am requesting a loan so that I can start a business and get a better interest rate for some debt/and to consolidate my payments.  I am itching to start a new venture but need some start-up capital.  Thank you in advance!
Thank you for your interest.  I plan to use this loan to pay off some high interest debt.  This will allow me to pay it off in five years, rather than the fifteen years or more that minimum monthly payments will take.  In the short term, I will reduce my payments by a small amount.  With the interest rate reduction and accelerated payoff rate, I will also save a considerable amount of money over the long term.  Thank you, again.

 556916 added on 10/14/09 > Funds will be used to immediately pay off several credit card balances (looking at different % amount on 4 to 5 cards to pay in full).  I have spent 10 years in the car business with the same company and I was raised by two bankers.  I understand the importance of making payments on time and I also understand that my credit card debt is not going anywhere if I only make the on time payments.  Consider my Chase Mortgage as a representation of my desire to have strong credit.  For a three month period I made 1/4 the monthly income that I normally would have due to the aftermath of Hurricane Ike.  It was tight, but I would not accept not being able to pay as agreed.  I deal with way too many people day to day that cant get what they want because they didnt take care of their credit.  To sum it up, my Grandad once told me "if you pay your bills and take care of your credit you wont ever go hungry".  He also said "if you cant pay cash then dont buy it", but we cant all be just like our Grandad.  I am not DESPERATE for this, but it sure as hell would give me a light at the end of the high credit card interest rate tunnel.  P.s. my wife is a registered nurse at 3800 to 4000 per month gross (11000+ household gross).  Experian becon is in the 690's...I prefer to leave her off of the note since her Ford lease is due in 8 months and I want to make sure her becon stay where it is at or gets higher. 556916 added on 10/17/09 > 702 Experian Becon Score 10/12/09 556916 added on 10/26/09 > ONLY 2 DAYS LEFT!!  This loan will be used to payoff accounts with payments equal to the payment amount on this contract.  My wife and I are stable in our jobs and have always proven the ability to pay.  This will give us a healthier outlook on our plan to eventually eliminate our credit card debt.  WE ARE A GOOD "RISK"!!!!  "Thank you" to those who have contributed.  You will not be disappointed.

Hello, I am looking for a loan to emabark in a house remodeling project.    I have a stable job with a Fortune 500 company making $80K a year. My experian credit score is 771 and I do not carry other major debt except for my house mortgage at $1,530 on a 30yr fix rate and a credit card with a balance under $1,500.  My car and my wife's car are paid in full.  I really like the concept of peer to peer lending I was a lender in another peer to peer lending website until they could not receive more lending funds due to a SEC application.  My user name is freshbroccoli and I invested over $6,000 in loans to other people.  I heard of this site and I decided to give it a try instead of going to my local bank.

I'm seeking to lower my Credit Card debt and pay back as quick as possible.    I'm currently paying 4 short term debts at $700 month but I am incurring at least $200 month in interest which is making this slow going.  I have $10k in cash I will be using along with the $25k I'm borrowing to eliminate 2 cards totally $32k.  I will use the remainder on a third card totalling $20k.    I am a responsible IT Professional with a stable income making $120k a year.  Unfortunately bad decisions in the past have been keeping me from being able to gain some momentum.  Paying off these debts would go a long way towards financial recovery for myself.  I really appreciate the help.  Thanks!

We are very experienced, knowledgeable, and good at what we do and we have stacks of results to prove it. However, many states require that you're licensed to do business in that state. And while it is our #1 goal to help as many families as we can, we wish only to operate 100% legally, ethically, & morally which includes maintaining proper licensing as required by each state, thus the reason for this small business loan assistance request. The licensing for our business to run in a particular state is not at all cheap, yet not in our budget to dish out all at once. So that is what this loan will be used for.<br/><br/>I am very much capable of repaying this loan. I'm very stable. I net a minimum of $3,000 per month. I'm willing to provide you with whatever documentation necessary upon request for this loan and can answer any questions you might have.<br/><br/>Thank you for giving my business a chance to grow and to help others. I look forward to doing business with you soon!<br/>

I dont have a lot, but due to a resent credit limit reduction I have been thrown dangerously close to exceeding max balance.  I should make it clear that credit limit was lowered due to unuse of credit cards for about 2 years.  Unfortunately not using them and trying to pay off existing balances has hurt me. I feel I am a reliable borrow and have paid off numerous bank loans and credit card balances in the past with no defaults. I have a very steady job in the healthcare industry and have been with this company for over 10 years. I prefer autodeduction as a payment plan and have been using this method for all of my loans.  I make sufficent funds to cover my debt grossing about $2600 a month, however, this winter and moving expenses have added some unexpected extra monthly payments. My goal is to pay ONE monthy affordable payment and be done with it.

Credit markets have tightened and I have some personal credit card debt.  Unfortunately most of the credit cards I have were used on promotional APRs, the rates have significantly gone up.  Althought I make more than minimum payments, it is hard to beat up rates this high.  Was hoping for something lower to get it cleared faster.

  Borrower added on 02/25/11 > I'd like to take a moment and explain why I have applied for this loan.  <br/><br/>I have 2 credit cards and 2 checking accounts that have Lines of Credit attached.  Every month when I make payments to each credit card I have to turn around and use the credit cards to buy gas and/or groceries.  When I make payments to the Lines of Credit I have to dip into them to pay bills.   I'm not getting ahead.  I feel I'm getting buried each month with more debt.  <br/><br/>If this loan is approved I will pay off both credit cards and closing them.  I will also pay down both lines of credit and have the limits reduced.  One line has a limit of $3000.  I don't want that.  One doesn't need that much in a line of credit.  I will have it lowered to $250.  The other line has a limit of $500.  I want to pay that down and have it lowered to $100.  <br/><br/>All together I am paying $320 a month for both cards and lines.  If I am approved for this loan I would be able to catch up on my other bills and actually start putting money aside and start saving.  <br/><br/>I hope this help you understand why this loan is important to me.  Thank you for your time.  <br/><br/>Denise<br/>

Thank you for your consideration in funding my loan.   Prior to the recession, I was a Sales position for Training and Development.   During the recession, with lower commissions, I began using my cards to supplement my income.  The money will be used for reducing my credit card balances into 1 payment at a lower interest rate (currently between 24% - 11%).   With my utilization high (60%), I am not in a position for better terms (i.e. one is 24% interest) nor getting my balances back to zero where they should be.  (I used to have CC balances zero, paid cash for cars).   This loan will also facilitate the higher credit score and the benefits that come with an excellent credit rating.  Im currently putting $2,000+ on my debt to eliminate it, but with this loan I could reduce it much faster.   It will also add an installment loan to my Credit Report and round it out nicely.    You make a little money, I save a little money.   Win:Win.  I welcome any questions you may have.
I have one credit card at 14% with a $6,000 balance and I am sick of paying so much interest to companies.  I would rather pay other people.

Over the years I have maintained a good to excellent credit rating, however, while working toward a nursing degree, I have become bogged down with credit card debt, requiring 4 or 5 different monthly payments and interest rates as high as 14.24%. Now that I am a semester away from earning a RN degree, consolidating this debt at a fixed lower interest rate would be of great benefit in simplifying my financial situation.

This year, I paid off 2 $5,000  60 unsecured loans early,and about $4500 in credit cards.  I have a good payment history, I believe its very important to pay back the money you borrow and to not over extend yourself.  I have another account with The Lending Club,Member_357044. That loan has  helped me consolidate some of my debt as well, but I also went above and beyond consolidating and outright paid a substantial portion off this year. I have a good history of paying back on time, if not early. The only current debt I have is my car lease, the loan I have with Lending Club now, and a credit line with citi; this loan would be the only new unsecured debt for the year.I encourage you to look my other account up, you will see that in a couple of months,January I believe, that loan will be half paid off. I encourage you to see how I have made consistent, timely payments.  As an individual that has lent money before to friends and family, I am aware of the risk you're taking. And as a borrower too, I would not want to be late on my payments because I do not want my credit to deteriorate, especially in this tight credit environment, but also,it is the right thing to do.  This money will help pay for the unexpected, costly damage to my car,and keep my liquidity in tact.  I can afford to take the money out of my account, like I said I just dont want to dig into my nest egg right now.  You can rest easy lending to me, I am reliable.<br/>

This loan will be used to repair a leak in the master bathroom and the associated damage caused by the leak.  Since repairs will require ripping out the entire shower, I want to update the bathroom as well. My budget for repair/renovation is less than the loan amount, but I've included a bit extra to cover for any overages  I don't carry much debt, aside from my mortgage, so repaying this loan will be my primary goal and I plan to repay in less than 3 years.

  551796 added on 10/06/09 > Hello and thank you for considering my loan request!  If granted the loan requested, I will be using the funds to pay off 2 of my credit card balances, most of which was incurred during Graduate School.  During the credit crisis, Bank of America increased my APR to 24%!  With an APR like that, I'll never get the balances paid down.  I'm working very hard to pay down my debts so I can begin saving and working towards the purchase of a home!  I'm incredibly reliable and have never defaulted on any debt.  Please consider helping me out. You will not be disappointed!  I am an accountant working towards my CPA. My job is incredibly stable and my income is more than sufficient to cover payments.  I am simply trying to take steps in the right direction to manage my debt effectively. Thank you again! I look forward to working with you. 551796 added on 10/07/09 > ANSWER TO StocksMan QUESTION:  Originally, I had hoped to consolidate all of my revolving debt, with the exception of 2 items which are interest free (GE Financial and Dell totaling approximately $1200.00).  However, given the interest rate I have been offered through Lending Club, it will only be beneficial for me to consolidate approximately $7,000.00 of my revolving debt (the 2 Bank of America CC) as the interest rate on these two cards is quite high.     Though you did not ask, I thought it may be helpful to understand where the majority of my debt came from.  I put myself through undergrad and grad school, and came out with VERY little debt in terms of school loans.  However, while in school, many of my living expenses (those expenses I could not cover by the income I earned while working) went onto my CC.  After graduating I was able to pay down my CC debt significantly.   However, I've recently had three deaths in my family and have incurred significant expenses on my credit cards, which is what brought me to lending club.  I would like to get these paid down sooner than later.   My other two debts include both a car loan and a student loan.  Roughly speaking, my monthly expenses total $1,700.00.  This includes my rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, cell phone, student loan payment, and ALL credit card payments.  After grad school, I joined a public accounting firm for 2 years.  I decided to join HealthCentral 1 Â½ years ago (18 months ago) to work as their internal Accountant. I report directly to the CFO.  Aside from specialized projects, my tasks generally include Accounts Payable, Billing, Monthly Closes, Audit Assistance, and maintaining valuable relationships with our media advertising clients.    I do have a savings account/emergency fund.  I had temporarily lent those funds to family given the extenuating circumstances.  However, I received a check yesterday, and will be replenishing that account this Friday, Oct 9th with $3,000.00. I am absolutely willing to provide income verification with Lending Club and will contact them now to find out how.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. Best!

  Borrower added on 06/21/10 > Hi there.  I was funded a loan through Prosper for credit consolidation at a higher rate with the intent to use that loan to pay down credit cards (as I have upon receipt of the loan).  Now that I have completed that part of my journey and discovered Lending Club, I would like to continue moving payments away from banks to share with fellow members at a lower rate to save money and ultimately reduce debt.  This loan will be used to pay off the prosper loan in its entirety, and the remaining balance will be used as a one time payment for school.  <br/><br/>As you will see, I never pay my bills late and my credit worthiness is consistent.  My priority is getting and keeping my credit as clear as possible since I am recently engaged with hopes to buy a house in a few years.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your time in considering investing in my loan.<br/>

Hi all,  First of all I love this site. I hope to be an investor once my loan is payed off. Gotta love that passive income.  Well my situation right now is that I've recently had a wedding, which added to some credit card debt that I already had obtained through furnishing a home I purchased a little over two years ago.  My credit is still great despite my high level of revolving debt-which is spread out across 4 cards right now, and I'm merely trying to consolidate into one loan for ease of payment and lower rate.  I've been employed with my current company for over five years now, and we have government contracts that are currently going to last well into 2014. We are in fact, expanding to triple our current production level within the next two years...and will be hiring while others are firing.  In other words, slim to none chance of layoff or job loss for the next five years.   My income is good and looks to be getting better. I just got a 4% raise which is excellent in the current economic climate, needless to say. In fact, I'm able to stuff 15% of my pay into a 401k even with my high debt payment. Can't stand to miss out on that employer match.  Well I won't bore you guys any longer, I really do appreciate anyone willing to help me out. I'll be joining your ranks in three years :)

I've got a couple other lines of credit that I'm going to continue paying down on my own, as the APRs on those are less atrocious and the balances are lower; having the high-rate accounts paid off with the LendingClub loan will make that process faster as well, causing the whole thing to snowball until I'm back to being debt-free.  Heck, at that point I might invest in LendingClub myself!<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time and support!<br/>

  Borrower added on 04/26/10 > I plan to use this loan to pay off my highest interest credit cards.  I have been managing my finances very responsible for the last two years after I graduated college and I'm looking for a faster way to pay off my debt.  I am throwing away money with these high interest credit cards that I acquired during college and I want that to stop.  I have set a goal of getting out of debt in 2 year.  I am currently in the process of starting a second job so I can pay off my debt even faster.  I am getting married in the next 2 years and I want to wipe my debt clean so I can start saving to buy a house.  I believe I am a good borrower because I have taken full responsibility for my debt and I'm now a responsible spender; I pay for everything with check or cash.  Also, I have paid all my bills on time and never miss payments.  I can't wait to be out of debt!  I have set many goals for myself, and getting out of debt is number 1 on my list.  I also have a very secure job that I have received promotions in regularly.<br/>
  Borrower added on 03/25/13 > Even though this loan is more then the interest rate I would have liked, looking at the total of the 3 credit cards I will paying off, and the amount that the finance company to replace the windows in my house wanted, your loan makes more sence.<br>

  Borrower added on 03/04/11 > The purpose of this Debt Consolidation Loan is to consolidate my higher interest credit cards and lines of credit into one manageable debt to have it paid off in preparation for my retirement.  With a loan from The Lending Club, the forecast is clear as to when the debt could actually be paid off.<br/>My previous loan of 3k from The Lending Club has allowed me to pay off a higher interest credit card, and pay back the loan without racking up huge finance charges that is associated with credit cards. My first loan (#463044) for $3,000 at 11.83% was borrowed and approved in December of 2009, and will be paid in full in March of 2011.<br/> I&rsquo;m making a request to borrow 35k to rid myself once and finally of all credit card and lines of credit debt that is associated with impossible interest rates.<br/>All requested income verification and other necessary documentation have been sent to The Lending Club.<br/>The steps being taken to get spending in line with my income is getting a lower interest rate to pay off debt faster, paying more towards my principal on my mortgage, more hours at work, and my pay increase in March and July 2011.<br/>My monthly commitments are: (Mortgage: $1584, Utilities: $170, Truck Lease: $502, Insurance: $200). My balances on my proposed pay-off debts are: (Wells Fargo: $6,427.70 at an interest rate of 23.99%), (Wells Fargo: $7078.70 at an interest rate of 27.99%), (Bankcard Services: $5774.41 at an interest rate of 17.99%), (Direct Merchants Bank: $4854.39 at an interest rate of 27.99%), (Lowes: $2257.86 at an interest rate of 26.99%), and (Dell: $1039.72 at an interest rate of 24.99%). <br/>The balances on these accounts weren&rsquo;t made due to a spending spree. Most were due to the purchase of inventory, business computers, and credit card equipment. My attempt at opening a women shoes/accessories store didn&rsquo;t pan out in this troubled economy.<br/>I have a first and second mortgage totaling $145,000 and an approximate low-end appraised value at $116,500.  I have a good and steady income stream in the petroleum transportation industry as a Pipeliner/Operator. My average monthly gross income is $8400. In case of job lost, I plan on utilizing the $115,789 in my savings to pay off some of the outstanding debt.  I plan on keeping this loan to full term.    I hope that this information provided suits potential lenders. If more information is needed, please ask.<br/>Thanks<br/>
I'm looking for a loan at a lower interest rate and better payment than what I currently on a few high interest credit cards.  I'd look to do this in order to free up some money due to having a baby recently and to put more money away each month in savings.
